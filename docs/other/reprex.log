You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see 
http://support.sas.com/rnd/migration/planning/platform/64bit.html

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

NOTE: Marker and line antialiasing has been disabled for at least one plot because the threshold has been reached. You can set 
      ANTIALIASMAX=35800 in the ODS GRAPHICS statement to enable antialiasing for all plots.
NOTE: The column format DATE9 is replaced by an auto-generated format on the axis.
NOTE: Some graph legends have been dropped due to size constraints. Try adjusting the MAXLEGENDAREA=, WIDTH= and HEIGHT= options in 
      the ODS GRAPHICS statement.
