Since we’ll be learning how to use a bunch of different software, the first step is to get everythign set up on your machine: git SAS 9.4 (or later) R (3.5 or higher) RStudio LaTeX You will also need to sign up for a GitHub account Module Objectives Set up R, Rstudio, SAS, LaTeX, and git on personal machines Use version control to track changes to documents and code 1.1 R and RStudio For an explanation of the differences between the R and RStudio and a short history lesson, see the expandable section below. R is a statistical computing language which originated as an open-source clone of Bell labs S computing language. S was inspired by Scheme, but also has features which are similar to Lisp. It is a scripting language (you don’t have to compile the code before it runs) and is natively accessed using a command-line prompt. One feature of R that is relatively unique is that it uses vector-based math, which means that mathematical operations on vectors occur for the entire vector without having to use loops to iterate through the vector line-by-line (this feature is common in languages designed for data manipulation, like SAS, Matlab, and julia; it is rare in more general computing languages). R is optimized for working on data: unlike more general-purpose programming languages such as Python, R was built with the idea of facilitating data analysis. As a result, data structures in R tend to be more natural for statistical work than similar structures in Python or C, which can feel unwieldly. From a computer science perspective, though, R seems like an extremely odd language because the design choices that make data analysis easier are unconventional for more general-purpose languages. RStudio is an integrated development environment for R. Basically, it adds a pretty graphical layer on top of R, providing an easy way to develop R code, evaluate that code, and keep track of all of the variables which are available in the computing environment. RStudio contains integrations which provide syntax highlighting, code folding, basic checks (missing parentheses, etc.), debugging tools, and many other features. RStudio was designed around the idea of making R easier to use and making it easy to develop statistical software reproducibly. RStudio (the company) is responsible for adding many features to the R ecosystem which facilitate running statistical analyses and presenting the results in user-friendly ways. Another useful explanation of R and RStudio can be found in Section 1 of ModernDive’s book 1.1.1 Getting Set up: R Note that the tutorial videos use versions of R that are old. You should be installing at least R 3.5 (if you have an older version, please update.) The basic installation process is the same, though, so the videos are still useful. R on Windows installation: R on Mac installation: R on Linux installation: On Linux, instead of a youtube video, you get a text-based tutorial. One of the Debian maintainers, Dirk Eddelbuettel, is also on R core, which means that R tends to work extremely well with Debian-based distributions, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint. R does work on RPM based distros, and you can of course also compile it from source for Arch/Gentoo, but I’ve stuck with Deb-based distributions for approximately 7 years because it seems to be a bit less hassle. Additional troubleshooting can be found here. ### Getting Set up: RStudio You can find RStudio at https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. You want the open source edition of RStudio Desktop. If you’re feeling brave, you can install the preview release - this may have a few bugs, but tends to be relatively stable and has the latest features. Please install RStudio 1.3.9+ for this class. If you’re on Linux, go ahead and import RStudio’s public key so that software validation works. (All of the commands are provided in the linked page) 1.1.2 Exploring RStudio The RStudio window will look something like this. In the top-left pane is the text editor. This is where you’ll do most of your work. In the top right, you’ll find the environment, history, and connections tabs. The environment tab shows you the objects available in R (variables, data files, etc.), the history tab shows you what code you’ve run recently, and the connections tab is useful for setting up database connections. On the bottom left is the console. There are also other tabs to give you a terminal (command line) prompt, and a jobs tab to monitor progress of long-running jobs. In this class we’ll primarily use the console tab. On the bottom right, there are a set of tabs: - files (to give you an idea of where you are working, and what files are present), - plots (which will be self-explanatory), - packages (which extensions to R are installed and loaded), - the help window (where documentation will show up), and - the viewer window, which is used for interactive graphics or previewing HTML documents. To get started, type 2+2 into the console window and hit enter. Now, type 2+2 into the text editor and press the run button that is on the pane’s shortcut bar (or, you can hit Ctrl-Enter/CMD-Enter to send a single line to the console). If both of those things worked, you’re probably set up correctly! Next, try typing this into the text editor, then run the line. Look in the environment and see if you can see what has changed. a &lt;- 3 # store 3 in the variable a Your environment window should now look something like this (the .Last.value entry may not be there, and that’s ok) You can use the environment window to preview your data, check on the status of variables, and more. Note that while R is running, the window doesn’t update (so you can’t check on the status of a loop while the loop is running using the window). 1.2 SAS SAS is another extensively used statistical programming language. It is primarily used for mixed models and in the biostatistics community (for e.g. drug trials). For SAS installation, see Steve Westerholt. He manages UNL SAS installations. Note SAS looks different on different machines. On Linux, SAS looks like you took a time machine back to the early 1990s. Screenshots from SAS will likely look very different on your machine than on mine. I will try to integrate screenshots from other OS’s where it matters. 1.3 Version Control with Git You don’t want to end up here. Version control is the answer to this problem. Git is a program whose primary purpose is version control. Git tracks changes to each file that it is told to monitor, and as the files change, you provide short labels describing what the changes were and why they exist (called “commits”). The log of these changes (along with the file history) is called your git commit history. When writing papers, this means you can cut material out freely, so long as the paper is being tracked by git - you can always go back and get that paragraph you cut out if you need to. You also don’t have to rename files - you can confidently overwrite your files, so long as you remember to commit frequently. The git material in this chapter is just going to link directly to the book “Happy Git with R” by Jenny Bryan. It’s amazing, amusing, and generally well written. I’m not going to try to do better. Go read Chapter 1.. 1.3.1 Getting set up: github See the instructions here 1.3.2 Getting set up: git See the instructions here Write down, or keep track of, the git installation path. This will make your life much easier. There is a troubleshooting guide that has some common problems which occur during git installation. 1.3.3 Introduce yourself to git You need to tell git what your name and email address are, because every “commit” you make will be signed. You can follow the instructions here, or just wait and run the R script to install and configure R, LaTeX, and packages. 1.3.4 Optional: Install a git client Instructions 1.3.5 Git and Github Slightly crude (but memorable) analogy: Git is to GitHub what Porn is to PornHub Git is a program that runs on your machine and keeps track of changes to files that you tell it to monitor. If you want, you can hook Git up to GitHub, and make a copy of your local git repository that lives in the cloud. Then, if you configure things correctly, your local repository will talk to GitHub without too much trouble. Using Github with Git allows you to easily make a cloud backup of your important code, so that even if your computer suddenly catches on fire, all of your important code files exist somewhere else. Remember: any data you don’t have in 3 different places is data you don’t care about.1 1.4 Easy Extra Setup Script Run this script on your machine. It will ask you for some input - your name, email address, etc. Then it’s going to run for a while, installing some packages (read the code file if you want to know what it’s doing - I’ve provided short explanations of what each package does). source(&quot;srvanderplas.github.io/unl-stat850/code/01_setup_install.R&quot;) This script will set up git for you (e.g. the introduce yourself to git section above) and then will install tinytex, which is a version of LaTeX that is very simple and easy to install. 1.5 LaTeX LaTeX is a typesetting program, which makes it different from most other document creation software, such as MS Word, which is “WYSIWYG” - what you see is what you get. In LaTeX, you’ll type in code to create a document, and LaTeX will compile the document into something pretty. The goal is that you have to think less about formatting and what goes on which page - LaTeX will handle that part for you - so that you can think more about the content. In practice, it doesn’t usually work out like that, so there are programs like markdown which aim to simplify document creation even more to free you from the formatting that LaTeX requires. LaTeX is often used for typesetting statistical and mathematical papers because its equation editor is top notch. (It was actually written by Donald Knuth because he got so annoyed trying to write his dissertation that he took some time off to write TeX first, and then used it to write his dissertation).^[Amusingly, knitr was written in much the same manner. Yihui Xie had to substitute-teach ISU’s version of 850 on the day we covered Sweave (a predecessor to knitr). He got so frustrated teaching the class that he went home and started writing knitr. Later, he developed Rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, and several other packages aimed at making writing documents + code easier to handle. Moral of the story - if you get frustrated with the tools you have, you’re in good company. Use it as fuel to make better tools.] We’ll work with LaTeX later in the semester, but for now, we’ll be primarily working with Markdown, which is much simpler. Here’s a quick cheatsheet. 1.6 Topic Sequencing In several places in this class, you’ll have to use material that you haven’t been formally taught yet. I will do my absolute best to provide thorough instructions, help you along as much as I can, and generally provide enough support that you can muddle through. But it’s going to be hard to teach you everything you need to e.g. plot some data, before providing you the opportunity to SEE that data. And it’s silly to teach you plotting before you know how to read data in. But to teach you how to read data in, you need to know about functions. You see my problem. So instead, what I’m going to do is to leave you lots of comments as to what a piece of code does when I’m using things you haven’t been formally shown yet. Then, you can copy/paste/modify those pieces of code, and if they break, you can ask why and we’ll dig into it (this is a good thing!). For each chapter, focus on learning how to write code that accomplishes that chapter’s objectives. If you understand some of the code you’re modifying that covers other topics not in that chapter, so much the better. But it’s not an expectation or a requirement. If you’re confused, please post on the class message boards so that those who have seen this material before can help you out. SAS quick start guide R quick start guide 1.7 Using Version Control XXX Need to fix this - write when GitHub Classroom setup is known XXX Yes, I’m aware that this sounds paranoid. It’s been a very rare occasion that I’ve needed to restore something from another backup. You don’t want to take chances. I knew a guy who had to retype his entire masters thesis from the printed out version the night before it was due because he had stored it on a network drive that was decommissioned. You don’t want to be that guy.↩ "],
["intro-prog.html", "Module 2 Introduction to Statistical Programming Module Objectives Definitions Statistical Programming Languages 2.1 Variable types 2.2 Data structures 2.3 Control structures 2.4 Overgrown Calculators References and Links", " Module 2 Introduction to Statistical Programming The only way to learn how to program effectively is to take something that works, break it, and then fix it again. There’s plenty of theory and you should definitely learn that, but fundamentally, if you are not regularly breaking code, you’re probably not programming. Figure 2.1: This is basically the class summarized, in meme format. The goal for this chapter (and several chapters to come) is that you can modify example code and adapt it to the problem at hand. This is the best way to learn how to program, but it means you may break the code and not know how to fix it. If that happens, please try the following steps: Google the error and see if you can understand why it happened. Consult with a classmate to see if they can understand where things broke. Post to the discussion board and see if anyone in the class can understand where things broke. (When you do this, post all of the code relevant to the problem, and the error you’re getting, so that your classmates can replicate the problem) If you do not hopelessly break code during this chapter, then please do your best to help others who may not have previously programmed (or previously programmed in these languages). While writing this chapter, I came across about 10 errors in SAS that I’d never encountered before. If all else fails, while you’re waiting for someone to help you figure out what an error message means… try this approach. Module Objectives Identify variable types, data structures, and common reserved words in R and SAS Use control structures (loops and conditionals) effectively Use matrix algebra functionality in R and SAS to perform basic calculations More informally, the goal is to get familiar with the basics of each programming language. Definitions Many programming resources talk about 3, or 5, or 10 core concepts in any programming language. In this module, we’re going to discuss the generic concepts, and then how these concepts are implemented in R and SAS. Interestingly, the “core concepts” aren’t necessarily the same across lists. So, here is a consensus list of concepts which are generic across languages and usually important: Variables - a symbolic name or reference to some kind of information. In the expression a + b &gt; a, both a and b are variables. Variables may have a specific type (what data can be stored in the variable), scope (where the variable can be accessed), location (in memory). Here is a nice explanation of the difference between variables in programming and variables in math. Conditional statements (if statements) - These statements allow the program to handle information adaptively - if a statement is true, one set of instructions will be used, and if the statement is false, a different set of instructions will be used. Looping and iteration - An iteration is any time a sequence of steps is executed. Most languages have several different types of loops or iteration: for loops, which allow for the sequence of steps to be executed a specific number of times, while loops, which allow for the sequence of steps to be executed while a conditional statement is true, recursion, where a block of code calls itself. Data types and data structures - these concepts determine what information a variable can hold. Data types are lower-level, simple objects (floating-point numbers, integers, boolean T/F, characters, strings). Data structures may include lists (sequences of many objects) and vectors (sequences of many objects of the same type), dictionaries (a list of key-value pairs), objects (data structures which may hold multiple related pieces of information). Functions, or self-contained modules of code that accomplish a particular task. Syntax, the set of rules that define which combinations of symbols consist of correctly structured and interpretable commands in the language. Tools, the set of external programs which may help with development and writing code. Some common tools are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), which may correct syntax and typos, organize files for you, allow you to keep track of which variables you have defined, and assist you with code organization and navigation. Other tools include compilers (which take human-written code and translate it into efficient machine code), version control systems (which help you track changes to code over time), debuggers, and documentation generators. Not all of these tools are necessary for all languages - scripting languages such as python and R do not require compilers by default, for instance. Sequence of commands: It’s important to have the right commands in the right order. Some recipes, like bread dough, are flexible, and you can add the ingredients in almost any order, but in other recipes, the order matters as much as the correct quantity of ingredients (try putting the cheese powder in before the noodles are boiled when making macaroni and cheese. Yuck.). Programming tends to be like these less flexible recipes. Statistical Programming Languages Having established the generic definitions of the concepts which apply to almost any programming language, we now must examine how R and SAS implement these concepts. R and SAS are both statistical programming languages - they are specifically designed to work with data, which means that they make compromises that other languages do not in order to make it easier to write code where the data (rather than the functions, classes, methods, or objects) are the primary concern. Both R and SAS have long histories. SAS in particular dates back to the 1960s, and has syntax which is unique compared to more modern languages such as C, python, Java, and R. R’s predecessor, S, dates back to 1976 and was designed for internal use at Bell Labs. The histories of both languages are useful in understanding why they are useful for their respective tasks, but are not essential for this course (so read them at your leisure). The biggest difference between R and SAS (at a fundamental level) is that R is a functional language - it consists mainly of functions, which can (and do) manipulate objects, including other functions. SAS, on the other hand, is a procedural language - most SAS programs follow a specific series of steps, known as “proc”s. Procs are essentially functions (or compositions of multiple functions), but in SAS, it is simpler to think of an analysis as a series of procedural steps; in R, there are steps, but they may be implemented in a more flexible way (depending on the analysis). Another interesting feature of SAS is that it’s really several languages - some commands work in PROC IML (interactive matrix language) but not in a DATA step. When looking for help in SAS, make sure you’re referencing the correct part of the language documentation. Basic Syntax and Cheatsheets SAS Cheatsheet (from another class like this) SAS Cheatsheet (by SAS) R Cheatsheet - this is a simplified cheat sheet offered by RStudio. R Cheatsheet (classic) SAS Programming for R Users (free book) I kept the classic R reference card by my computer for about 5 years, and referenced it at least once or twice a day for that entire period. There will be other cheat sheets and reference cards scattered through this book because if you can’t remember something’s name, you might be able to remember where it is on the reference card (or at least, that’s how I learned R). 2.1 Variable types Variable types are sufficiently different in R and SAS that we will cover R first, then SAS. For a general overview, though, this video, titled ‘Why TRUE + TRUE = 2’ is an excellent introduction. 2.1.1 R In R, there are 4 commonly-used types: Type Description character holds text-based information: “abcd” or “3.24a” are examples of values which would be stored as characters in R logical holds binary information: 0/1, or FALSE/TRUE. Logical variables are stored as single bit information (e.g. either a 0 or 1), but display as TRUE and FALSE (which are reserved words and constants). integer holds (as you might expect) integers. Note that integers are handled differently than doubles (floating point numbers), but in general, R will implicitly convert integers to doubles to avoid common pitfalls with integer divison (which does not allow for decimals). double holds floating point numbers. By default, most numeric variables in R are doubles. You can test to see whether a variable holds a value of a specific type using the is.xxx() functions, which are demonstrated below. You can convert a variable of one type to another with as.xxx() functions. You can test what type a variable is using typeof(). Note that &lt;- is used for assigning a value to a variable. So x &lt;- &quot;R is awesome&quot; is read “x gets ‘R is awesome’” or “x is assigned the value ‘R is awesome’”. Character variables x &lt;- &quot;R is awesome&quot; typeof(x) [1] &quot;character&quot; is.character(x) [1] TRUE is.logical(x) [1] FALSE is.integer(x) [1] FALSE is.double(x) [1] FALSE Logical Variables x &lt;- FALSE typeof(x) [1] &quot;logical&quot; is.character(x) [1] FALSE is.logical(x) [1] TRUE is.integer(x) [1] FALSE is.double(x) [1] FALSE It is possible to use the shorthand F and T, but be careful with this, because F and T are not reserved, and other information can be stored within them. Integer Variables x &lt;- 2 typeof(x) [1] &quot;double&quot; is.character(x) [1] FALSE is.logical(x) [1] FALSE is.integer(x) [1] FALSE is.double(x) [1] TRUE Wait, 2 is an integer, right? 2 is an integer, but in R, values are assumed to be doubles unless specified. So if we want R to treat 2 as an integer, we need to specify that it is an integer specifically. x &lt;- 2L # The L immediately after the 2 indicates that it is an integer. typeof(x) [1] &quot;integer&quot; is.character(x) [1] FALSE is.logical(x) [1] FALSE is.integer(x) [1] TRUE is.double(x) [1] FALSE is.numeric(x) [1] TRUE Double Variables x &lt;- 2.45 typeof(x) [1] &quot;double&quot; is.character(x) [1] FALSE is.logical(x) [1] FALSE is.integer(x) [1] FALSE is.double(x) [1] TRUE is.numeric(x) [1] TRUE Numeric Variables A fifth common “type”2, numeric is really the union of two types: integer and double, and you may come across it when using str() or mode(), which are similar to typeof() but do not quite do the same thing. The numeric category exists because when doing math, we can add an integer and a double, but adding an integer and a string is … trickier. Testing for numeric variables guarantees that we’ll be able to do math with those variables. is.numeric() and as.numeric() work as you would expect them to work. The general case of this property of a language is called implicit type conversion - that is, R will implicitly (behind the scenes) convert your integer to a double and then add the other double, so that the result is unambiguously a double. 2.1.1.1 Type Conversions R will generally work hard to seamlessly convert variables to different types. So, for instance, TRUE + 2 [1] 3 2L + 3.1415 [1] 5.1415 &quot;abcd&quot; + 3 Error in &quot;abcd&quot; + 3: non-numeric argument to binary operator This conversion doesn’t always work - there’s no clear way to make “abcd” into a number we could use in addition. So instead, R will issue an error. This error pops up frequently when something went wrong with data import and all of a sudden you just tried to take the mean of a set of string/character variables. Whoops. When you want to, you can also use as.xxx() to make the type conversion explicit. So, the analogue of the code above, with explicit conversions would be: as.double(TRUE) + 2 [1] 3 as.double(2L) + 3.1415 [1] 5.1415 as.numeric(&quot;abcd&quot;) + 3 Warning: NAs introduced by coercion [1] NA When we make our intent explicit (convert “abcd” to a numeric variable) we get an NA - a missing value. There’s still no easy way to figure out where “abcd” is on a number line, but our math will still have a result - NA + 3 is NA. If you are unsure what the type of a variable is, use the typeof() function to find out. w &lt;- &quot;a string&quot; x &lt;- 3L y &lt;- 3.1415 z &lt;- FALSE typeof(w) [1] &quot;character&quot; typeof(x) [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(y) [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(z) [1] &quot;logical&quot; 2.1.1.2 Factors In R, there is one other type of variable to know about, and that is a factor. Factors are basically labeled integers. Instead of storing the data as a string or character, R instead stores the data as a series of integers, and then stores a separate table mapping the integers to labels. This is technically more efficient, but it is also (and this is the technical term) a pain in the ass. Factors are the default way to store characters for most base R functions. Or rather, they were. In R 4.0, the default way to read data in will change from stringsAsFactors = T to stringsAsFactors = F.3 Factors example Let’s look at the names of the months: month.name [1] &quot;January&quot; &quot;February&quot; &quot;March&quot; &quot;April&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;June&quot; [7] &quot;July&quot; &quot;August&quot; &quot;September&quot; &quot;October&quot; &quot;November&quot; &quot;December&quot; df &lt;- data.frame(num = 1:12, name = month.name, stringsAsFactors = T) # I&#39;m putting the argument in so that this is still relevant when everyone switches to R 4.0 # Even with stringsAsFactors = F, factors are still useful and we still need to work with them. str(df) &#39;data.frame&#39;: 12 obs. of 2 variables: $ num : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... $ name: Factor w/ 12 levels &quot;April&quot;,&quot;August&quot;,..: 5 4 8 1 9 7 6 2 12 11 ... Notice that as soon as we make that data.frame, the months are converted into a factor variable? The other big problem is that the order of the factor levels is … not what we’d normally want. We don’t want alphabetical ordering of month names - they have a different, implicit, and natural order. To fix this, we can explicitly specify that we’re dealing with a factor, and what we want the levels to be. If you specify the levels manually (instead of letting R do the work for you) then you get to determine the order. month_fct &lt;- factor(month.name, levels = month.name) str(month_fct) Factor w/ 12 levels &quot;January&quot;,&quot;February&quot;,..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... We can even be more explicit: month_fct &lt;- factor(month.name, levels = month.name, ordered = T) str(month_fct) Ord.factor w/ 12 levels &quot;January&quot;&lt;&quot;February&quot;&lt;..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... Making the factor ordered lets us explicitly say which levels are less than other levels. Factors are technically integers, with labels that are stored as an attribute. That doesn’t mean you can do math with them, though. month_fct[1] + month_fct[2] Warning in Ops.ordered(month_fct[1], month_fct[2]): &#39;+&#39; is not meaningful for ordered factors [1] NA Often, years or dates or other numeric-like information will end up as factor variables. When this happens, you need to be a little bit careful. # This works pretty naturally for months, right? as.numeric(month_fct) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 yfact &lt;- factor(2000:2020, levels = 2000:2020) yfact [1] 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 [16] 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 21 Levels: 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 ... 2020 # But, this does not... as.numeric(yfact) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 as.character(yfact) # gets the labels [1] &quot;2000&quot; &quot;2001&quot; &quot;2002&quot; &quot;2003&quot; &quot;2004&quot; &quot;2005&quot; &quot;2006&quot; &quot;2007&quot; &quot;2008&quot; &quot;2009&quot; [11] &quot;2010&quot; &quot;2011&quot; &quot;2012&quot; &quot;2013&quot; &quot;2014&quot; &quot;2015&quot; &quot;2016&quot; &quot;2017&quot; &quot;2018&quot; &quot;2019&quot; [21] &quot;2020&quot; as.numeric(as.character(yfact)) # gets the info we want [1] 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 [16] 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 When converting factors with numeric labels, you need to first convert the factor to a character, and then to a numeric variable. That will get the information you actually want back out. ::: tryitout #### Try It Out Create variables string, integer, decimal, and logical, with types that match the relevant variable names. string &lt;- integer &lt;- decimal &lt;- logical &lt;- Can you get rid of the error that occurs when this chunk is run? logical + decimal integer + decimal string + integer What happens when you add string to string? logical to logical?

Adding a logical to a logical, e.g. TRUE + TRUE, results in 2, which is a numeric value. ::: 2.1.2 SAS In SAS, there are two basic variable types: numeric and character variables. Thus, SAS does not differentiate between integers and floats or doubles. Functionally, though, the same basic operations can be performed in SAS. As with R, SAS does attempt to implicitly convert variable types, and will notify you that the conversion has taken place in the log file. 2.1.2.1 Type Conversions SAS will attempt to implicitly convert variables when: a character value is assigned to a previously defined numeric variable a character value is used in arithmetic operations a character value is compared to a numeric value using a comparison operator (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=) a character value is specified in a function that takes numeric arguments Implicit conversion does not occur in WHERE statements. (This will make more sense later, but is here for reference) Manual type conversions If you want to manually convert a value, the INPUT statement can be used. Unlike in R, the INPUT statement has the ability to read numbers which are formatted differently. For instance proc printto log=&quot;saslog.log&quot; new; data set1; /* This tells SAS we&#39;re defining some variables */ x = 3; y = &#39;3.1415&#39;; z = x * y; /* this is arithmetic, so y will be converted */ x = &#39;3.14159&#39;; /* x previously had a number in it, */ /* so it will be converted to a number here */ zz = y&lt;=2; /* comparison operator: y will be converted */ put z; /* This prints the result to the log */ put x=; put zz=; run; Notice that in SAS, zz, which is the result of the logical statement y&lt;=2, is a numeric variable. The value 0 signifies that the comparison was false. SAS does not have a logical data type, it uses the numeric variable with 0:=FALSE, 1:=TRUE.

Of primary interest in statistical programming are the following types of structures:   Homogeneous Heterogeneous 1d vector list 2d matrix data frame (R) or data set (SAS) nd array (R) In the table above, homogeneous means that all entries in the structure must be of the same type. Heterogeneous means that the entries are allowed to be of different types. Figuring out what to call these types with two languages is hard - in SAS, an array is a group of columns of a data set, but in R, it’s a multi-dimensional matrix. In this section, we’ll discuss the generic concepts relevant to both languages. The differences between the two languages will be discussed as appropriate. As there are more similarities than differences, it’s easier to do this in a single section rather than duplicating half of the content. 2.2.1 Homogeneous data structures (R and SAS) R does not have scalar types - even single-value variables are technically vectors of length 1. SAS does have scalar types. If we try to create a heterogeneous vector in R, using the concatenate function, c(), which combines scalar entries into a vector, what happens? c(1, 2, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot; Because there were 3 character entries, the entire vector is now a character vector. This behavior can cause some errors - for instance, R does not read in numeric data formatted with commas as numeric data. You may thus get the result x &lt;- c(356, 452, &quot;1,325&quot;) mean(x) Warning in mean.default(x): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA [1] NA If you are reading in data from a file, this will cause some issues - the whole column of data will be formatted as characters. Keep an eye out for errors of this type. Jenny Bryan has an excellent set of images to demonstrate R data types as legos. She’s released them under an open license, so I am shamelessly stealing them. Logical vector Factor vector Integer and Numeric vectors These correspond to the 1-dimensional homogeneous data structures. Similarly, models can be made for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional homogeneous data structures4: Vector (1D) Matrix (2D) Array (3D) 2.2.2 Heterogeneous data structures The heterogeneous data types are not much harder to grasp, as they’re mostly different ways to combine various homogeneous data types. 2.2.2.1 Lists A list is, well, a list - a sequence of potentially different-typed values. Unlike when concatenating values, the list() command in R allows each value to keep its natural type. You can access elements of a list using [] (this will extract a subset of the list items) or [[]], which will extract a single item from the list. (there will be more on this in the Indexing section below) Basic List Syntax in R x &lt;- list(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, 1, 2, 3) x [[1]] [1] &quot;a&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;b&quot; [[3]] [1] &quot;c&quot; [[4]] [1] 1 [[5]] [1] 2 [[6]] [1] 3 x[[3]] [1] &quot;c&quot; x[[4]] + x[[5]] [1] 3 x[1:2] # This will work [[1]] [1] &quot;a&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;b&quot; x[[1:2]] # This won&#39;t work Error in x[[1:2]]: subscript out of bounds The lego version of a list looks like this: Figure 2.2: A list of 4 vectors. Even though the vectors in the list are all the same size in this case, they don’t have to be, because they’re not organized in any sort of cohesive rectangle shape. A data frame (see below) is essentially a list where all of the components are vectors or lists of the same length. Indexing in Lists Some lists (and data frames) consist of named variables. These list components can be accessed either by index (as above) or by name, using the $ operator. Names which have spaces or special characters must be enclosed in backticks (next to the 1 on the keyboard). Named components can also be accessed using the [[ ]] operator. dog &lt;- list(name = &quot;Edison Vanderplas&quot;, age = 8, breed = &quot;Jack Russell Terrorist&quot;, `favorite toy` = &quot;a blue and orange stuffed duck. Or rawhide.&quot;, `link(video)` = &quot;https://youtu.be/zVeoQTOTIuQ&quot;) dog $name [1] &quot;Edison Vanderplas&quot; $age [1] 8 $breed [1] &quot;Jack Russell Terrorist&quot; $`favorite toy` [1] &quot;a blue and orange stuffed duck.

Or rawhide.&quot; dog[[&quot;link(video)&quot;]] [1] &quot;https://youtu.be/zVeoQTOTIuQ&quot; You can get a sense of the structure of a list (or any other object) in R using the str() command. str(dog) List of 5 $ name : chr &quot;Edison Vanderplas&quot; $ age : num 8 $ breed : chr &quot;Jack Russell Terrorist&quot; $ favorite toy: chr &quot;a blue and orange stuffed duck. Or rawhide.&quot; $ link(video) : chr &quot;https://youtu.be/zVeoQTOTIuQ&quot; Recursive lists Lists can also contain other lists. When accessing a list-within-a-list, just add another index or name reference (see below). grocery_list &lt;- list( dairy = list(&quot;asiago&quot;, &quot;fontina&quot;, &quot;mozzarella&quot;, &quot;blue cheese&quot;), baking = list(&quot;flour&quot;, &quot;yeast&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;), canned_goods = list(&quot;pepperoni&quot;, &quot;pizza sauce&quot;, &quot;olives&quot;), meat = list(&quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;sausage&quot;, &quot;anchovies&quot;), veggies = list(&quot;bell pepper&quot;, &quot;onion&quot;, &quot;scallions&quot;, &quot;tomatoes&quot;, &quot;basil&quot;) ) ick &lt;- c(grocery_list[[4]][2:3], grocery_list$canned_goods[[3]]) ick [[1]] [1] &quot;sausage&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;anchovies&quot; [[3]] [1] &quot;olives&quot; crust_ingredients &lt;- c(grocery_list$baking, &quot;water&quot;) crust_ingredients [[1]] [1] &quot;flour&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;yeast&quot; [[3]] [1] &quot;salt&quot; [[4]] [1] &quot;water&quot; essential_toppings &lt;- c(grocery_list$dairy[3], grocery_list$canned_goods[2]) essential_toppings [[1]] [1] &quot;mozzarella&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;pizza sauce&quot; yummy_toppings &lt;- c(grocery_list$dairy[c(1, 2, 4)], grocery_list$meat[1], grocery_list[[5]][c(3, 5)]) yummy_toppings [[1]] [1] &quot;asiago&quot; [[2]] [1] &quot;fontina&quot; [[3]] [1] &quot;blue cheese&quot; [[4]] [1] &quot;bacon&quot; [[5]] [1] &quot;scallions&quot; [[6]] [1] &quot;basil&quot; Basic List Syntax in SAS There are also lists in SAS IML which function similarly to lists in R. To create a named object in a list, precede the name with #. In SAS, the $ operator can be used to get items from a list, using either name or numeric references. proc iml; grocery_list = [ #dairy = [&quot;asiago&quot;, &quot;fontina&quot;, &quot;mozzarella&quot;, &quot;blue cheese&quot;], #baking = [&quot;flour&quot;, &quot;yeast&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;], #canned = [&quot;pepperoni&quot;, &quot;pizza sauce&quot;, &quot;olives&quot;], #meat = [&quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;sausage&quot;, &quot;anchovies&quot;], #veggies= [&quot;bell pepper&quot;, &quot;onion&quot;, &quot;scallions&quot;, &quot;tomatoes&quot;, &quot;basil&quot;] ]; /* print only works on matrices and vectors */ /* so we&#39;ll cheat and load another library to print lists */ package load ListUtil; /* run ListPrint(grocery_list); */ /* This would print the thing, but it&#39;s long */ ick = [grocery_list$&quot;canned&quot;$3, grocery_list$4$2, grocery_list$4$3]; crust = grocery_list$&quot;baking&quot;; call ListAddItem(crust, &quot;water&quot;); /* add an item to a list */ essential_toppings = [grocery_list$&quot;dairy&quot;$3, grocery_list$&quot;canned&quot;$2]; yummy_toppings = [grocery_list$&quot;dairy&quot;$1, grocery_list$&quot;dairy&quot;$2, grocery_list$&quot;dairy&quot;$4, grocery_list$&quot;meat&quot;$1, grocery_list$5$3] ; /* The || is a concatenation operator, like c(). */ /* It is inefficient for large data sets */ run ListPrint(ick); run ListPrint(crust); run ListPrint(yummy_toppings); quit; ——— List = ick——— Item 1 olives Item 2 sausage Item 3 anchovies ——— List = crust——— Item 1 flour Item 2 yeast Item 3 salt Item 4 water ——— List = yummy_toppings——— Item 1 asiago Item 2 fontina Item 3 blue cheese Item 4 bacon Item 5 scallions Try it out Using the list of pizza toppings above as a starting point, make your own list of pizza toppings organized by grocery store section (approximately). Create your own vectors of yummy, essential, and ick toppings, using R and SAS. 2.2.2.2 Data frames (R only) A data frame is a special type of list - one in which each element in the list is a vector of the same length. If you put these vectors side-by-side, you get a table of data that looks like a spreadsheet. The lego version of a data frame looks like this: Figure 2.3: A data frame with data frame 4 columns. A data frame is essentially a list where all of the components are vectors or lists, and are constrained to have the same length. Basic Data Frame Syntax When you examine the structure of a data frame, as shown below, you get each column shown in a row, with its type and the first few values in the column. The head() command shows the first 6 rows of a data frame (enough to see what’s there, not enough to overflow your screen). head(mtcars) ## A data frame included in base R mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 str(mtcars) &#39;data.frame&#39;: 32 obs. of 11 variables: $ mpg : num 21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ... $ cyl : num 6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ... $ disp: num 160 160 108 258 360 ... $ hp : num 110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ... $ drat: num 3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ... $ wt : num 2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ... $ qsec: num 16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ... $ vs : num 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ... $ am : num 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ gear: num 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ... $ carb: num 4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ... You can change column values or add new columns easily using assignment. It’s also easy to access specific columns to perform summary operations. mtcars$gpm &lt;- 1/mtcars$mpg # gpm is sometimes used to assess efficiency summary(mtcars$gpm) Min. 1st Qu.

Max. 10.40 15.43 19.20 20.09 22.80 33.90 Often, it is useful to know the dimensions of a data frame. The number of rows can be obtained by using nrow(df) and similarly, the columns can be obtained using ncol(df) (or, get both with dim()).

Tibbles A tibble is a fancy data frame that is optimized to work with the tidyverse, which is a collection of R packages that make data wrangling (getting the data clean and ready for analysis) easier. You can read about tibbles here. You like data frames? Lists? Let’s put some lists inside a data frame! (All about list columns) Let’s start with the lego picture: (The full explanation is available in slide form here). A list is just another object that could be stored in a data frame! It is a “generalized vector” in that each entry in a list can be thought of as another list - so a list is really a vector of lists. List-columns make it possible to store e.g. whole data sets in a nested, organized way. Another useful feature is that each entry in a list-column doesn’t have to be the same length, which makes it easier to store “ragged” data. You can see a couple of examples here (but they assume that you know things that you’ll only learn in a few modules). Data Sets (SAS) The SAS data set structure is similar to a R data frame. This is a schematic of a data set as taken from the SAS documentation In SAS, missing values are indicated with .. SAS datasets also come with a description which is attached to the table. The descriptor portion of the data set records names of variables (and attributes), numbers of observations, and date/time stamps of creation and updates. Creating a SAS data set In the next code chunk, we’ll create a data set using a SAS Data step. We’ll talk more about the anatomy of a SAS command later, but for now, notice that I’m specifying some metadata (the title), telling SAS what the variable names are (Drugs, Score), and then providing some data (indicated by the datalines statement). /* Data source: http://blog.yhat.com/posts/7-funny-datasets.html */ data mathMJ; title &#39;Average math test scores under the influence of LSD&#39;; input Drugs Score; datalines; 1.17 78.93 2.97 58.20 3.26 67.47 4.69 37.47 5.83 45.65 6.00 32.92 6.41 29.97 ; /* Describe the dataset */ proc datasets; contents data = mathMJ; run; proc print data = mathMJ; run; Average math test scores under the influence of LSD Directory Libref WORK Engine V9 Physical Name /tmp/SAS_work895500006FEA_silicon Filename /tmp/SAS_work895500006FEA_silicon Inode Number 11538753 Access Permission rwx—— Owner Name susan File Size 4KB File Size (bytes) 4096 # Name Member Type File Size Last Modified 1 MATHMJ DATA 128KB 06/17/2020 11:57:30 2 PROFILE CATALOG 12KB 06/17/2020 11:57:30 3 REGSTRY ITEMSTOR 32KB 06/17/2020 11:57:30 4 SASMAC3 CATALOG 20KB 06/17/2020 11:57:30 Average math test scores under the influence of LSD Data Set Name WORK.MATHMJ Observations 7 Member Type DATA Variables 2 Engine V9 Indexes 0 Created 06/17/2020 11:57:31 Observation Length 16 Last Modified 06/17/2020 11:57:31 Deleted Observations 0 Protection Compressed NO Data Set Type Sorted NO Label Data Representation SOLARIS_X86_64, LINUX_X86_64, ALPHA_TRU64, LINUX_IA64 Encoding latin1 Western (ISO) Engine/Host Dependent Information Data Set Page Size 65536 Number of Data Set Pages 1 First Data Page 1 Max Obs per Page 4061 Obs in First Data Page 7 Number of Data Set Repairs 0 Filename /tmp/SAS_work895500006FEA_silicon/mathmj.sas7bdat Release Created 9.0401M6 Host Created Linux Inode Number 11545246 Access Permission rw-rw-r– Owner Name susan File Size 128KB File Size (bytes) 131072 Alphabetic List of Variables and Attributes # Variable Type Len 1 Drugs Num 8 2 Score Num 8 Average math test scores under the influence of LSD Obs Drugs Score 1 1.17 78.93 2 2.97 58.20 3 3.26 67.47 4 4.69 37.47 5 5.83 45.65 6 6.00 32.92 7 6.41 29.97 The last two blocks are SAS procedures (PROCs).

In the second block, I’m telling SAS to print the whole mathMJ dataset out. 2.2.3 Indexing The 1, 2, and multi-dimensional homogeneous data types should be familiar from e.g. linear algebra and calculus. Single elements of a vector can be extracted using single square brackets, e.g. x[1] will get the first element of the vector x. In a matrix, elements are indexed as row, column, so to get the (2, 2) entry of a matrix x, you would use x[2,2]. This is extended for multi-dimensional arrays in R, with each dimension added, e.g. x[3,1,2] or x[4, 3, 2, 1]. To get a full row or column from a matrix (in both SAS and R) you would use x[1,] (get the first row) or x[,3] (get the 3rd column). To select multiple rows or columns from a matrix, you would use x[, c(1, 3)] in R or x[,{1 3}] in SAS - both options get the first and third column of the matrix, with all rows of data included. In both R and SAS, a:b where a and b are numbers will form a sequence from a to b by 1s. So 1:4 is 1, 2, 3, 4. This is often used to get a set of rows or columns: x[3:4, 1:2]. R matrix example x &lt;- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5, byrow = T) # Create a matrix with values 1 to 20, 5 rows, and fill by row x [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 1 2 3 4 [2,] 5 6 7 8 [3,] 9 10 11 12 [4,] 13 14 15 16 [5,] 17 18 19 20 x[3:4, 1:2] [,1] [,2] [1,] 9 10 [2,] 13 14 # Gets a submatrix SAS matrix example In SAS, the same basic code works (though matrix definition is a bit more manual). proc iml; /* Interactive Matrix Language */ x = {1 2 3 4 5, 6 7 8 9 10, 11 12 13 14 15, 16 17 18 19 20}; y = x[3:4, 1:2]; print x; /* Here, print is used instead of put */ print y; quit; /* exit proc IML */ x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 y 11 12 16 17 Both R and SAS are 1-indexed languages, so the elements of a list or vector are indexed as 1, 2, 3, 4, …5 As R has logical vectors, it is possible to index a vector using a logical vector of the same length. Try it out (From project Euler) If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. Hint: The modulo operator, %%, gives the integer remainder of one number divided by another. So a %% b gives the integer remainder when dividing a by b. Modular division is often used to find multiples of a number. R solution x &lt;- 1:999 # all nums below 1000 m3 &lt;- (x %% 3) == 0 # multiple of 3 m5 &lt;- (x %% 5) == 0 # multiple of 5 m3or5 &lt;- m3 | m5 sum(x[m3or5]) [1] 233168 SAS solution data tmp; do x = 1 to 999; output; end; run; proc summary data=tmp; /* Summarize data */ where (mod(x, 3) = 0) | (mod(x, 5) = 0); /* Keep only obs where x is divisible by 3 or 5 */ var x; /* what variable we want the summary for */ output out=sum_x sum=; /* output sum_x to a new dataset */ run; proc print data = sum_x; /* print our sum_x dataset */ run; Obs TYPE FREQ x 1 0 466 233168 Most complicated structures in R are actually lists underneath. You should be able to access any of the pieces of a list using a combination of named references and indexing. If you have trouble distinguishing between $, [, and [[, you’re not alone. The R for Data Science book has an excellent illustration, which I will summarize for you here in abbreviated form (pictures directly lifted from the book). R4DS indexing illustration x | x[1] | x[[1]] | x[[1]][[1]] — | —— | ——– | ————- | | | 2.3 Control structures 2.3.1 If statements If statements are just about as simple in programming as they are in real life. Figure 2.4: Source. I’ve actually met some programmers who talk like this in real life. General structure of an if statement In general, the structure of an if statement is if (condition) then { # do something here } If the condition is true, the inner code will be executed. Otherwise, nothing happens. You can add an else statement that will execute if the condition is not true if (condition) then { # do something } else { # do a different thing } And in some languages, you can even have many sets of if statements: if (condition) { # do something } else if (condition 2) { # do something else } else { # do a third thing } Note that this could also be written (perhaps more clearly) as: if (condition) { # do something } else { if (condition 2) { # do something else } else { # do a third thing } } That is, condition 2 is only checked once it is known that condition is false. Often, programmers use logic flow maps, like the one shown below, to map out a logical sequence and ensure that every possible value is handled appropriately. Example: If/then logic in SAS and R The syntax for conditional statements using if/then logic is shown below using an example where Santa must determine which members of a household will receive a toy for Christmas and which members will receive coal.6 In R tmp &lt;- data.frame(name = c(&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Edison&quot;, &quot;Susan&quot;, &quot;Ryan&quot;), status = c(&quot;naughty&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;, NA, &quot;neutral&quot;), stringsAsFactors = F) # Santa&#39;s decision process if (tmp$status == &quot;naughty&quot;) { tmp$present &lt;- &quot;coal&quot; } else { tmp$present &lt;- &quot;toy&quot; } Warning in if (tmp$status == &quot;naughty&quot;) {: the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used tmp name status present 1 Alex naughty coal 2 Edison nice coal 3 Susan &lt;NA&gt; coal 4 Ryan neutral coal What happened? When evaluating if statements, R does not evaluate each entry in the vector tmp$status separately. Instead, it takes the first value and issues a warning message. One option would be to use a loop, and examine each row in the data set separately. We’ll talk about loops in the next subsection. Another option is to use the ifelse() function, which is ifelse(condition, thing to do if condition is true, thing to do if condition is false) tmp$present &lt;- ifelse(tmp$status == &quot;naughty&quot;, &quot;coal&quot;, &quot;toy&quot;) tmp name status present 1 Alex naughty coal 2 Edison nice toy 3 Susan &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 4 Ryan neutral toy When R evaluates a missing value, (so ? NA == “naughty”), the result is NA. This is fine for us - if we don’t have data on whether someone is naughty or nice, maybe we don’t need to give them a present at all. But “neutral” is evaluated as getting a toy. Do we want that to happen? Maybe not. We might have to nest ifelse statements to solve this issue… tmp$present &lt;- ifelse(tmp$status == &quot;naughty&quot;, &quot;coal&quot;, ifelse(tmp$status == &quot;nice&quot;, &quot;toy&quot;, NA)) tmp name status present 1 Alex naughty coal 2 Edison nice toy 3 Susan &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 4 Ryan neutral &lt;NA&gt; In SAS In a data step: data santa; input name $ status $; datalines; Edison nice Alex naughty Susan . Ryan neutral ; /* Modify santa_list and make a new dataset, present_list */ data presents; set santa; if status = &quot;naughty&quot; then present = &quot;coal&quot;; else present = &quot;toy&quot;; run; /* must end with run if no datalines option */ proc print data=presents; run; Obs name status present 1 Edison nice toy 2 Alex naughty coal 3 Susan toy 4 Ryan neutral toy Note that ., or missing data is handled the same as ‘nice’. That might not be what we wanted… this is the natural thing to do, right? data santa; input name $ status $; datalines; Edison nice Alex naughty Susan . Ryan neutral ; /* Modify santa_list and make a new dataset, present_list */ data presents; set santa; if status = &quot;naughty&quot; then present = &quot;coal&quot;; else (if status = &quot;nice&quot; then present = &quot;toy&quot; else present = .); run; /* must end with run if no datalines option */ proc print data=presents; run; SAS doesn’t handle nested if statements very well - they can be ambiguous. Instead, SAS documentation suggests using do; and end; to denote the start and end points of each if statement (like the {} in R). data santa; input name $ status $; datalines; Edison nice Alex naughty Susan . Ryan neutral ; data presents; set santa; if status = &quot;naughty&quot; then do; present = &quot;coal&quot;; end; else if status = &quot;nice&quot; then do; present = &quot;toy&quot;; end; else do; present = .; end; run; proc print data=presents; run; Obs name status present 1 Edison nice toy 2 Alex naughty coal 3 Susan . 4 Ryan neutral . Interestingly, if you set a character variable to be missing, SAS converts it to ‘.’. So, if we actually want to have the value be missing, we can set it to an empty string. data santa; input name $ status $; datalines; Edison nice Alex naughty Susan . Ryan neutral ; data presents; set santa; if status = &quot;naughty&quot; then do; present = &quot;coal&quot;; end; else if status = &quot;nice&quot; then do; present = &quot;toy&quot;; end; else do; present = &#39;&#39;; end; run; proc print data=presents; run; Obs name status present 1 Edison nice toy 2 Alex naughty coal 3 Susan 4 Ryan neutral Now things work the way we expected them to work. There are more complicated if-statement like control structures, such as switch statements, which can save time and typing. In the interests of simplicity, we will skip these for now, as any conditional can be implemented with sequences of if statements in the proper order. If you would like to read about switch statements, here are links to SAS case statement documentation and base R switch statement explanation and documentation. Try it out The sample() function selects a random sample of entries from a vector. Suppose we sample a random vector \\(x\\) with 10 entries. Write one or more if statements to fulfill the following conditions if \\(x\\) is divisible by 2, \\(y\\) should be positive; otherwise, it should be negative. if \\(x\\) is divisible by 3, \\(y\\) should have a magnitude of 2; otherwise, it should have a magnitude of 1. It may be helpful to define separate variables y_mag and y_sign and then multiply them afterwards. Once you have found the value of \\(y\\) compute \\(\\text{sum}(x * y)\\). You may use the following R and SAS code skeletons to set the problem up. set.seed(342502837) x &lt;- sample(1:50, size = 20, replace = F) # Conditional statements go here sum(x * y) [1] 1567.609 proc iml; call randseed(342502837); x = sample(1:50, 20)`; create sampledata from x [colname = &quot;x&quot;]; append from x; close; quit; data xy; set sampledata; /* Conditional statements go here */ /* Leave this so that the code below works */ res = x * y; run; proc summary data=xy; /* Summarize data */ var res; /* what variable we want the summary for */ output out=tmpsum sum=; /* output tmpsum to a new dataset */ run; proc print data = xy; /* print our original dataset to check result */ var x y res; sum res; run; proc print data = tmpsum; /* print our tmpsum dataset */ run; R Solution set.seed(342502837) x &lt;- sample(1:50, size = 20, replace = F) y_sign &lt;- ifelse(x %% 2 == 0, 1, -1) y_mag &lt;- ifelse(x %% 3 == 0, 2, 1) y &lt;- y_sign * y_mag sum(x * y) [1] 157 SAS Solution proc iml; call randseed(342502837); x = sample(1:50, 20)`; create sampledata from x [colname = &quot;x&quot;]; append from x; close; quit; data xy; set sampledata; y_sign = 0 * x; y_mag = 0 * x; /* Conditional statements go here */ if MOD(x, 2) = 0 then y_sign = 1; else y_sign = -1; if MOD(x, 3) = 0 then y_mag = 2; else y_mag = 1; y = y_sign * y_mag; res = x * y; run; proc summary data=xy; /* Summarize data */ var res; /* what variable we want the summary for */ output out=tmpsum sum=; /* output tmpsum to a new dataset */ run; proc print data = xy; /* print our original dataset to check result */ var x y res; sum res; run; proc print data = tmpsum; /* print our tmpsum dataset */ run; Obs x y res 1 44 1 44 2 42 2 84 3 1 -1 -1 4 7 -1 -7 5 42 2 84 6 13 -1 -13 7 27 -2 -54 8 19 -1 -19 9 41 -1 -41 10 16 1 16 11 6 2 12 12 44 1 44 13 26 1 26 14 48 2 96 15 22 1 22 16 15 -2 -30 17 40 1 40 18 1 -1 -1 19 27 -2 -54 20 13 -1 -13 235 Obs TYPE FREQ res 1 0 20 235 See this to understand how the print statement works and how to add column summary values. 2.3.2 Loops Often, we need to do a single task many times - for instance, we may need to calculate the average data value for each week, using daily data. Rather than typing out 52 different iterations of the same code, it is likely easier to type out one single block of code which contains the steps necessary to complete one instance of the task, and then leverage variables to ensure that each task is completed the correct number of times, using the correct inputs. Let us start with the most generic loop written in pseudocode (code that won’t work, but provides the general idea of the steps which are taken) loop_invocation(iteration variable, exit condition) { # Steps to repeat } We use the loop_invocation function to indicate what type of loop we use. We have at least one iteration variable that indicates where in the looping process we currently are. This may be an index (if we want to do something 500 times, it would take values from 1 to 500), or it may take a more complicated sequence of values (for instance, if we are testing convergence, we might put some sort of delta variable as the iteration variable). Most loops also have an explicit exit condition that is part of the loop invocation; more rarely, a loop may depend on break statements that cause the control flow of the code to exit. Without some sort of exit condition, our program would run forever, which is… not optimal. 2.3.2.1 Count controlled loops (FOR loops) In a for loop, the steps in the loop body repeat a specified number of times. That is, for each value in a sequence, the steps within the loop are repeated. Example: Santa and if/else + loops in R (plus some debugging strategies) For instance, suppose we want to revisit our R Santa example from the previous section. The original if/else code we wrote in R didn’t work, because R evaluates if statements using a single (scalar or vector of length 1) condition. If we add a loop around that code, we can evaluate only one row at a time. We need to check every row, so we’ll iterate over 1:nrow(tmp) - it’s better to get the upper bound from the data frame, rather than just using 4 - if we add another entry, the code will still work if we’re using nrow(tmp) to define how many iterations we need. We start by defining our data frame: tmp &lt;- data.frame(name = c(&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Edison&quot;, &quot;Susan&quot;, &quot;Ryan&quot;), status = c(&quot;naughty&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;, NA, &quot;neutral&quot;), stringsAsFactors = F) And then we add the basic loop syntax: for (i in 1:nrow(tmp)) { } For some reason, i is often used as the iteration variable (with j and k for nested loops). What this loop says is that i will first take on the value 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. On each iteration, i will advance to the next value in the vector of options we have provided. Now we need to add the middle part by adapting the conditional statement we used before so that it looks at only the ith row. I’ve also added the catch-all else condition that assigns NA for any value that isn’t “naughty” or “nice”. It’s good practice to initialize your variable (create a column for it) ahead of time and set the variable to a default value. tmp$present &lt;- NA # Initialize column and set to NA by default for (i in 1:nrow(tmp)) { # Santa&#39;s decision process if (tmp$status[i] == &quot;naughty&quot;) { tmp$present[i] &lt;- &quot;coal&quot; } else if (tmp$status[i] == &quot;nice&quot;) { tmp$present[i] &lt;- &quot;toy&quot; } else { tmp$present[i] &lt;- NA_character_ # use a special NA value that has # character type to avoid any issues } } Error in if (tmp$status[i] == &quot;naughty&quot;) {: missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed Well, that didn’t work! We can see that the loop stopped at i = 3 by printing out the value of i - because the loop failed, i will still contain the value which caused the loop to stop. i [1] 3 tmp[i,] # print tmp at that point name status present 3 Susan &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Combining this information with the error above, we can guess that R stopped evaluating the loop because the if statement returned NA (missing) instead of TRUE or FALSE. if/else statements in R can’t evaluate to NA, so we need to restructure our conditional statement - first, we’ll test for NA values, then, we can test for naughty and nice, and we’ll keep the catch-all statement at the bottom. We’ll test for an NA value using the function is.na(). tmp$present &lt;- NA # Initialize column and set to NA by default for (i in 1:nrow(tmp)) { # Santa&#39;s decision process if (is.na(tmp$status[i])) { tmp$present[i] &lt;- NA_character_ } else if (tmp$status[i] == &quot;naughty&quot;) { tmp$present[i] &lt;- &quot;coal&quot; } else if (tmp$status[i] == &quot;nice&quot;) { tmp$present[i] &lt;- &quot;toy&quot; } else { tmp$present[i] &lt;- NA_character_ } } tmp name status present 1 Alex naughty coal 2 Edison nice toy 3 Susan &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 4 Ryan neutral &lt;NA&gt; Now the if/else logic works exactly as intended. This is longer than the version using ifelse(), but it is perhaps more readable. In most cases in R and SAS, it is possible to write code without needing loops at all, because both languages are vector-based - they will often use vectorized functions which implicitly loop over each row without having to write a loop to do so. ifelse() is a vectorized version of if() {} else {}. Here is an example of the most basic for loop logic - printing the numbers 1 through 10 - in both R and SAS. SAS code is provided for both PROC IML and DATA steps. For loops in R # R Example loop for (i in 1:10) { print(i) } [1] 1 [1] 2 [1] 3 [1] 4 [1] 5 [1] 6 [1] 7 [1] 8 [1] 9 [1] 10 “For loops” in SAS IML (using do) /* SAS IML example loop */ proc iml; do i = 1 to 10; print i; end; /* This ends the loop definition */ quit; i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 i 5 i 6 i 7 i 8 i 9 i 10 “For loops” in a SAS DATA step /* SAS DATA step example loop */ proc printto log=&quot;saslog.log&quot; new; /* shows output log in bookdown */ data A; do i = 1 to 10; put i=; end; /* This ends the loop definition */ run; NOTE: PROCEDURE PRINTTO used (Total process time): real time 0.00 seconds cpu time 0.00 seconds 4 data A; 5 do i = 1 to 10; 6 put i=; 7 end; /* This ends the loop definition */ 8 run; i=1 i=2 i=3 i=4 i=5 i=6 i=7 i=8 i=9 i=10 NOTE: The data set WORK.A has 1 observations and 1 variables. NOTE: DATA statement used (Total process time): real time 0.00 seconds cpu time 0.00 seconds Another explanation of for loops is available at Khan Academy. While the most straighforward (and common) case of for-loop use in practice is to count from 1 to N, both R and SAS allow for loops to use other sequence structures. Other sequences in loops in R R allows loops to occur over any vector… even randomly generated numbers, or nonnumeric vectors (say, a character vector of URLs). x &lt;- rnorm(5) # Generate 5 normal (0,1) samples for (i in x) { print(i^2) } [1] 4.500349 [1] 3.820737 [1] 2.656216 [1] 1.120775 [1] 2.10086 We can also iterate by non-integer values using seq(from = , to = , by = ) # This loop counts down in 1/2 units from 5 to 0 for (i in seq(5, 0, -.5)) { # do nothing } Other sequence structures in SAS for loops We can iterate by non-integer values: proc printto log=&quot;saslog.log&quot; new; /* to shows output log in bookdown */ data A; y = 0; do i = 5 to 0 by -0.5; put i=; end; run; NOTE: PROCEDURE PRINTTO used (Total process time): real time 0.00 seconds cpu time 0.00 seconds 3 data A; 4 y = 0; 5 do i = 5 to 0 by -0.5; 6 put i=; 7 end; 8 run; i=5 i=4.5 i=4 i=3.5 i=3 i=2.5 i=2 i=1.5 i=1 i=0.5 i=0 NOTE: The data set WORK.A has 1 observations and 2 variables.

(Documentation) You can install the package using the following command: install.packages(&quot;beepr&quot;) (if you are using Linux you will also need to make sure one of paplay, aplay, or vlc is installed) Load the library and write a for loop which plays the 10 different sounds corresponding to integers 1 through 10. library(beepr) # load the beepr library beep(sound = 1) # sound is any integer between 1 and 10. It may be helpful to add the command Sys.sleep(5) into your loop to space out the noises so that they can be heard individually. Solution library(beepr) for (i in 1:10) { beep(sound = i) Sys.sleep(5) } Try it out (in SAS) Write a for loop which will output the first 30 fibbonacci numbers. You can use the following code as a starting point: /* SAS IML example loop */ proc iml; current = 1; prev = 0; quit; Solution /* SAS IML example loop */ proc iml; current = 1; prev = 0; do i = 1 to 30; new = current + prev; prev = current; current = new; print current; end; /* This ends the loop definition */ quit; current 1 current 2 current 3 current 5 current 8 current 13 current 21 current 34 current 55 current 89 current 144 current 233 current 377 current 610 current 987 current 1597 current 2584 current 4181 current 6765 current 10946 current 17711 current 28657 current 46368 current 75025 current 121393 current 196418 current 317811 current 514229 current 832040 current 1346269 2.3.2.2 Condition-controlled loops (WHILE, DO WHILE) Frequently, we do not know how many times a loop will need to execute a priori. We might be converging on a value, and want to repeat the calculation until the new value is within an acceptably epsilon of the previous iteration. In these cases, it can be helpful to use a WHILE loop, which loops while the condition is true (another variant, the do-while loop, is similar, except that a do-while loop will always execute once, and checks the condition at the end of the iteration). If a WHILE loop condition is never falsified, the loop will continue forever. Thus, it is usually wise to include a loop counter as well, and a condition to terminate the loop if the counter value is greater than a certain threshold. Example: Let’s solve the Basel problem in R and SAS using WHILE loops - we’ll repeat the calculation until the value changes by less than 0.000001. The Basel problem is the problem of calculating the precise infinite summation \\[\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\] We’ll stick to calculating it computationally. In R # Start out by defining your starting values outside of the loop i &lt;- 1 basel_value &lt;- 0 # initial guess prev_basel_value &lt;- -Inf # previous value while (abs(basel_value - prev_basel_value) &gt; 0.000001) { prev_basel_value &lt;- basel_value # update condition basel_value &lt;- basel_value + 1/i^2 i &lt;- i + 1 # Prevent infinite loops if (i &gt; 1e6) { break } # Monitor the loop to know that it&#39;s behaving if (i %% 200 == 0) { print(c(&#39;i = &#39; = i, &#39;prev&#39; = prev_basel_value, &#39;current&#39; = basel_value, diff = basel_value - prev_basel_value)) } } i = prev current diff 2.000000e+02 1.639896e+00 1.639922e+00 2.525189e-05 i = prev current diff 4.000000e+02 1.642425e+00 1.642431e+00 6.281368e-06 i = prev current diff 6.000000e+02 1.643263e+00 1.643266e+00 2.787060e-06 i = prev current diff 8.000000e+02 1.643682e+00 1.643683e+00 1.566414e-06 i = prev current diff 1.000000e+03 1.643933e+00 1.643934e+00 1.002003e-06 i [1] 1001 basel_value [1] 1.643935 prev_basel_value [1] 1.643934 In SAS proc iml; i = 1; basel = 0; prev = -1; do while((basel - prev) &gt; 1e-6); prev = basel; basel = basel + 1/i**2; /* ** is the exponent operator */ i = i + 1; if i &gt; 1e6 then do; leave; end; if MOD(i, 200) = 0 then do; print i, prev, basel; end; end; print i, basel; quit; i 200 prev 1.6398963 basel 1.6399215 i 400 prev 1.6424247 basel 1.6424309 i 600 prev 1.6432632 basel 1.643266 i 800 prev 1.6436817 basel 1.6436833 i 1000 prev 1.6439326 basel 1.6439336 i 1001 basel 1.6439346 Another explanation of while loops is available at Khan Academy. Try it out Write a while loop in R and in SAS to calculate \\(\\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 4} \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{x}}{4-x}\\) by starting at 3 and halving the distance to 4 with each iteration. Exit the loop when you are within 1e-6 of the value computed on the previous iteration, or when you are within 1e-6 from 4. Which exit condition did you hit first? How do you know?

Higher level iteration may include a FOREACH loop, where a series of commands is applied to a list or vector (the *apply commands in R are examples of this). An additional method of iteration that requires functions is the recursion (where a function calls itself). In every case, these alternative loop structures can be translated to for or while loops. 2.4 Overgrown Calculators While R and SAS are both extremely powerful statistical programming languages, the core of both languages is the ability to do basic calculations and matrix arithmetic. As almost every dataset is stored as a matrix-like structure (data sets and data frames both allow for multiple types, which isn’t quite compatible with more canonical matrices), it is useful to know how to do matrix-level calculations in R and SAS. In this section, we will essentially be using both R and SAS as overgrown calculators.

In R, A^-1 will get you the elementwise reciprocal of the matrix. Not exactly what we’d like to see… Instead, in both languages, we use the solve() function. The inverse is defined as the matrix B such that AB = I where I is the identity matrix (1’s on diagonal, 0’s off-diagonal). So if we solve(A) (in R) or solve(A, diag(n)) in SAS (where n is a vector of 1s the size of A), we will get the inverse matrix.

While replication covers the lab methods, experimental design, and data collection procedures, reproducibility is concerned with the code and the data from an experiment which has already been run. Specifically, the idea is that the research paper is basically an advertisement - by exposing the code and data used in the analysis, readers can engage with the core of the analysis methods, leading to better peer feedback as well as easier adoption of the research for future work. Reproducibility has several advantages: It allows you to show the correctness of your results Trying to reproduce an analysis from the data and the description in the journal article is… challenging, if not impossible, in many cases. By providing the raw data and code to take the data from raw form to analysis results, readers can verify the legitimacy of each step in the analysis. This allows researchers to review each others methods, finding mistakes due to bugs in the software used or due to implementation errors. In one particularly prominent failure of reproducibility, a study used to support macroeconomic theories that shaped the response to the 2008-2009 recession negatively correlating national debt with gdp growth was found to be flawed due to an excel indexing mistake. Use of GUI-based (graphical user interface) statistical analysis software may make it harder to identify these mistakes, because the formulas and code are not visually displayed. It allows others to use your results more easily By sharing your code and raw data, you provide the wider scientific community with the ability to use your results to build new scientific studies. This increases the relevance of your work, the number of citations your papers get, and you also benefit from the community adopting a culture of openness and reproducibility. In 2 years, when you need to find the code you used for that analysis in XXX paper, you’ll be able to find the code (and the data) to see how it worked and what you did. The code may or may not run as-is (depending on software versioning, package updates, etc.), but you will have the methods clearly documented along with the data (so it’s easy to replicate the data format needed, etc.) There are other advantages (personal and public) described in an issue of Biostatistics dedicated to reproducibility. David Donoho’s response is particularly useful. As you might expect, there are many different types of reproducibility. Code reproducibility - allows replication of the computing aspects of the study. Includes code, software, hardware, and implementation details. Data reproducibility - allows replication of the non-computational parts of the study (e.g. experiment and data collection). This may include making protocols and data available. Statistical reproducibility - allows replication of the statistical methods. Includes details about model parameters, thresholds, etc. and may also include study pre-registration to prevent p-hacking. There are also many levels of reproducibility. Much of the computer code written in the 1960s is no longer runnable today, because the computer architecture it was written for is not available anymore. Code which depends on URLs is vulnerable to website rearrangements or the content no longer being hosted. Archiving projects on GitHub is nice, but what happens if GitHub goes down? It’s important to decide what type of reproducibility is important for a particular project, and then design the project’s workflow around that process. For most of my projects, I don’t worry about software versioning (I may archive my sessionInfo() so that package versions are documented) and storing the software packages alongside the code and data. As much as possible, I keep the code and the data (if it’s small) on GitHub in a public repository for people to access, along with any manuscripts or presentations related to the project. Manuscripts are written in knitr or r markdown, so that the code is documented by the context of the project, and every image in the article generated by R has corresponding code available. This ensures that my code (and data) is stored somewhere off-site (backed up in the cloud) my code is available if others want to use it I can track my contributions to a project relative to any collaborators I can reuse blocks of code easily In situations where I run experiments, I also make sure that any experimental stimuli or other code that would contribute to the execution and data collection part of the experiment is also included in the repository. Stimuli are archived as well. The github reproducibility work flow is convenient - it allows for me to easily collaborate with others, without emailing versions of code and documents back and forth. I can revert changes that are made that had unintentional effects fairly easily. I can sync my files across multiple machines effortlessly. And if necessary, I can look back at the changes I’ve made and see why I made them, or what I’ve already tried. 3.1.1 Reproducibility References and Reading Advanced R’s reproducibility guide A reproducible R workflow ROpenSci’s guide to reproducibility Roger Peng’s Biostatistics editorial on reproducibility The Biostatistics reproducibility issue w/ responses to the editorial and associated commentary 3.2 Markdown In this class, we’re primarily going to use rmarkdown to create dynamic documents. Markdown itself is a special style of text that is intended to allow you to do basic formatting without having to pause to actually click the buttons (if you were writing in word). It integrates equation functionality (so you can type mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax) and also allows for the use of templates (so you can write whole journal articles in a text editor). Markdown is also program agnostic - it will allow you to compile your work into HTML, word, or PDF form. Markdown documents must be compiled - a computer program runs and transforms the text file into a full document. RStudio has markdown functionality built-in, and also supports rmarkdown, which is a markdown variant designed to make it easy to integrate R code with document creation (so-called literate programming). There are other markdown programs which extend markdown’s functionality so that you can write a book (like this one), create presentations or posters, or maintain a blog in markdown. Rmarkdown, despite the name, also allows you to integrate the results from code in other languages. As you saw in the last chapter, SAS code can be integrated into markdown as well. Other languages commonly used include python, julia, SQL, Bash, C++, and Stan. There is a full set of Rmarkdown tutorials from RStudio. There is also a handy cheatsheet. Rmarkdown documents may contain code used to support an analysis, but they are usually not the best way to develop an analysis method - they are better for documentation, writing tutorials, and other scenarios where you need both text explanations and code/analysis/results. There are other “containers” for code, though, including functions, scripts, and packages. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages, and can be used together. 3.2.1 Rmarkdown with… SAS? You may have noticed that I’ve been including SAS chunks throughout this book, and even in your homework assignments. Here’s how that’s set up. SAS in Rmarkdown – guide. It’s really fairly simple. 3.3 Functions and Modules A function (or a module, in SAS) is a block of code which is only run when it is called. It takes arguments (known as parameters) and returns data or some other value. There is some extensive material on this subject in R for Data Science on functions. If you aren’t familiar with functions, you should read that material before proceeding. Let’s look at the structure of a generic function in pseudocode (code that isn’t really part of any language, but describes the steps of a program): my_function_name = function(param1, param2 = 3) { step1 // do something step2 // do something else return step_1/step2 } The first part of a function declaration (storing information in a named object) is the function’s intended name, my_function_name. Then, we indicate that we are defining a function, and what parameters our function requires. For param1, we do not provide a default value, but for param2, we indicate that the default value is 3. Thus, if we call the function (tell the program to run this function with certain arguments and provide the result), we could either say my_function_name(param1 = value1, param2 = value2) or my_function_name(param1 = value1) (which is equivalent to my_function_name(param1 = value1, param2 = 3)). Inside the function block (indicated by {} here, but some languages may use do ... end;), we perform whatever steps we’ve decided to include in the function, and then at the end of the function, we return a value - the function exits, and leaves behind some information. In R, functions look like this: function( arglist ) { expr return(value) } In SAS, functions are called modules and look like this: Statements That Define and Execute Modules Modules are used to create a user-defined subroutine or function. A module definition begins with a START statement, which has the following general form: START &lt;name&gt; &lt;( arguments )&gt; &lt;GLOBAL( arguments )&gt;; A module definition ends with a FINISH statement, which has the following general form: FINISH &lt;name&gt;; To execute a module, you can use either a RUN statement or a CALL statement. The general forms of these statements are as follows: `RUN &lt;name&gt; &lt;( arguments)&gt;; `CALL &lt;name&gt; &lt;( arguments)&gt;;` The only difference between the RUN and CALL statements is the order of resolution. Source: SAS function reference Let’s try functions out by writing a simple function that takes two numbers as arguments and adds them together. adder &lt;- function(a, b) { return(a + b) } adder(3, 4) [1] 7 proc IML; start adder(a, b); return(a + b); finish; c = adder(3, 4); print c; quit; c 7 Of course, it’s not just important to be able to write your own functions. It’s also helpful to be able to see how functions are written, both to explore how a method is implemented and for debugging purposes. In SAS, this is generally not an option, because SAS is closed source, but in R, you can see the code behind any function which is implemented in R (it is harder to see functions implemented in C or C++, but not impossible) by typing the function name (no parentheses) into the command prompt. Let’s examine how the colSums() function is implemented: colSums function (x, na.rm = FALSE, dims = 1L) { if (is.data.frame(x)) x &lt;- as.matrix(x) if (!is.array(x) || length(dn &lt;- dim(x)) &lt; 2L) stop(&quot;&#39;x&#39; must be an array of at least two dimensions&quot;) if (dims &lt; 1L || dims &gt; length(dn) - 1L) stop(&quot;invalid &#39;dims&#39;&quot;) n &lt;- prod(dn[id &lt;- seq_len(dims)]) dn &lt;- dn[-id] z &lt;- if (is.complex(x)) .Internal(colSums(Re(x), n, prod(dn), na.rm)) + (0+1i) * .Internal(colSums(Im(x), n, prod(dn), na.rm)) else .Internal(colSums(x, n, prod(dn), na.rm)) if (length(dn) &gt; 1L) { dim(z) &lt;- dn dimnames(z) &lt;- dimnames(x)[-id] } else names(z) &lt;- dimnames(x)[[dims + 1L]] z } &lt;bytecode: 0x55fb2dfb5d38&gt; &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; You can see that the first 3 steps in the function are if statements to test whether the inputs are acceptable - x must be a data frame, a matrix, or an array (with 2+ dimensions). The next couple of lines test to see whether there are additional “column” dimensions (don’t worry if you don’t understand what’s going on in this code - it’s highly optimized and a bit arcane). Then, the function checks to see if x is real-valued or complex, and if it’s complex, computes the real and imaginary sums separately. The .Internal(colSums(x...)) part is calling a C function - basically, functions written in C are faster than R because they’re compiled, so this speeds basic operations up in R. Then there are statements that transfer dimension names over to the summed object. At the end of the function, the last value computed is returned automatically (in this case, z). Try it out Write a function named circle_area which computes the area of a circle given the radius. Make sure to use reasonable parameter names! (Note: in R, pi is conveniently stored in the variable of the same name - it can be overwritten if you want to do so, but why would you want to do that? In SAS, you can get the value of pi using constant(&quot;pi&quot;)) circle_area &lt;- function(r) { r^2*pi # automatically returned as the last computed value } circle_area(5) [1] 78.53982 A more complete and robust answer might include a test for numeric r: circle_area &lt;- function(r) { if (!is.numeric(r)) { stop(&quot;Supplied radius must be numeric&quot;) # This issues an error } r^2*pi # automatically returned as the last computed value } circle_area(5) [1] 78.53982 proc IML; start circle_area(r); pi = constant(&quot;pi&quot;); return(pi*r**2); finish; c = circle_area(5); print c; quit; c 78.539816 One last trick to note: functions generally can only return one object. If you need to return more than one thing, put the objects into a list or another data structure, and return that - then you can take the list/structure apart outside the function to use the returned values separately. 3.3.1 Scope The scope of a variable is the space in the program where a variable is defined and can be accessed. A local variable is one which can only be accessed within a function or block of code - it does not exist outside of that code. A global variable is one which is available to the entire program. 3.3.1.1 Scoping in R Every function is defined in a certain environment, and once it is defined, executed in a specific environment. Think of an environment as a space full of available variables, functions, and objects. Any defined object or variable that a function has access to is in scope. When you are inside of a function block, you have access to values defined within the function, plus any other values outside the function. When there are two variables with the same name, the object in the environment which is “closest” is used. Demonstration of scoping in R: a &lt;- 3 myfun &lt;- function(a, b) { a + b + 2 } myfun(5, 6) # a is 5 inside the function, so that overrides the [1] 13 # a defined outside the function myfun(a, 3) # this references the a outside the function [1] 8 Scope diagram. When myfun() is called, the calling environment contains the two parameters a and b. a &lt;- 3 myfun2 &lt;- function(d) { myfun(a, d) } myfun2(3) # the only a in scope inside fun2 is the a defined at the top of the chunk [1] 8 Scope diagram. When myfun2() is called, the calling environment contains only a parameter \\(d\\). \\(a\\) is pulled from the global environment, as there is no parameter \\(a\\) in the myfun2 calling environment. a &lt;- 3 myfun3 &lt;- function(a, d) { b &lt;- a; # make a copy of the value a &lt;- 250; myfun(b, d) } a [1] 3 myfun3(5, 3) # now, a is defined inside fun3 as a = 5, so there is an a in [1] 10 # fun3&#39;s scope that isn&#39;t in the global environment. a # value of a hasn&#39;t changed [1] 3 Scope diagram. When myfun3() is called, the calling environment contains parameters a and d, which are then copied into the calling environment of myfun as \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The variable \\(a\\) in the global environment is ignored. If you want to avoid too many issues with scoping (because scoping rules are complicated), the simplest way is to not reuse variable names inside of a function if you’ve already used those names outside the function. R does have global variables and a global assignment operator, &lt;&lt;-, but the use of global variables is strongly discouraged, and global variables are not permitted in e.g. CRAN packages. 3.3.1.2 Scoping in SAS In SAS, scoping rules are more like those in other programming languages - you have to keep track of how arguments are made available to the function. Demonstration of scoping in SAS. Environments do not inherit variables from the calling environment. PROC IML; a = 3; start myfun(a, b); return a + b + 2; finish; r1 = myfun(5, 6); /* a is 5 inside the function, so that overrides the a defined outside the function */ r2 = myfun(a, 3); /* this references the a outside the function */ print r1 r2; quit; r1 r2 13 8 In SAS, the equivalent version of the program used to demonstrate lexical scoping in R produces an error. In SAS, you cannot assume the function has access to values defined outside of that function that are not passed into the function as arguments. PROC IML; a = 3; start myfun(a, b); return a + b + 2; finish; start myfun2(d); return myfun(a, d); /* SAS complains because a is not defined */ finish; r1 = myfun2(3); print r1; quit; First, let’s consider the similarities: like R, functions have a local scope, and changing a similarly named value inside the function doesn’t change the value outside the function. PROC IML; start myfun(x); y = 2 * x; print y[label=&quot;y inside function (local)&quot;]; return 1; finish; y = 0; x = 1:5; res = myfun(x); print y[label=&quot;y outside function&quot;]; quit; y inside function (local) 2 4 6 8 10 y outside function 0 However, R’s environment feature and lexical scoping is not common to many other programming languages. When values are passed into the function as arguments, the behavior in SAS deviates from the equivalent behavior in R. In SAS, arguments to functions are passed by reference. An argument that is passed by value makes a copy of the value (to a new memory location) for the local function scope (this is what R does). When an argument is passed by reference, the address of the argument is passed in instead7. This is faster and more efficient (because you aren’t making a new copy of the data), but it does mean that changes inside the function persist outside that function. Example: Argument passing in R and SAS In SAS: If we make a slight modification to myfun(a, b), though, we see some interesting behavior in SAS that we wouldn’t see in the equivalent R program. PROC IML; a = 3; start myfun(a, b); a = a + 2; return a + b; finish; b = a; r1 = myfun(5, 6); c = a; r2 = myfun(a, 3); d = a; print b[label=&quot;a before r1&quot;] r1 c[label=&quot;a after r1&quot;] r2 d[label=&quot;a after r2&quot;]; quit; a before r1 r1 a after r1 r2 a after r2 3 13 3 8 5 In R: In R, variables inside a function don’t modify variables which are outside a function (generally speaking). In SAS, this is not necessarily the case. In the first call to myfun(), we pass in two numerical arguments, and we see that even though the value of a changes inside the function, that change doesn’t affect the variable defined outside of the function. In the second call to myfun(), we pass a variable in as an argument, and we see that the variable changes after the function’s execution! In the R chunk (below), you can see that the behavior of what is essentially the same code is different. a &lt;- 3 myfun &lt;- function(a, b) { a &lt;- a + 2 a + b } a [1] 3 myfun(5, 6) [1] 13 a [1] 3 myfun(a, 3) [1] 8 a [1] 3 Here’s another example of SAS passing arguments by reference (and the unexpected effects that can have on a program’s state): PROC IML; start myfun(x); call sort(x, 1); /* sort the values */ return (cusum(x)); /* cusum() = cumulative sum */ finish; y = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 4}; z = y; print y[label=&quot;y before function is called&quot;]; cs = myfun(y); print z[label=&quot;original y&quot;] y[label=&quot;y after function is called&quot;] cs[label=&quot;cumulative sum of sorted y&quot;]; quit; y before functionis called 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 4 original y y after functionis called cumulative sumof sorted y 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 2 4 1 3 7 5 4 11 9 4 15 2 5 20 6 5 25 5 6 31 4 9 40 Because arguments in SAS are passed by reference, you can “trick” a function into returning multiple values by passing the variables in as arguments to the function, changing their values in the function, and returning. This is not necessarily a good practice - it can make code very difficult to debug, and may lead to non-obvious dependencies - but for short, simple programs, you can probably get away with it. PROC IML; start getDescriptive(Mean, SD, /* output args */ x /* input arg */); Mean = x[:]; /* this is shorthand for compute the mean of the column */ SD = sqrt( ssq(x - Mean)/(nrow(x) - 1)); finish; m = 0; s = 0; y = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 4}; run GetDescriptive(m, s, y); print m s; quit; m s 4 2.4494897 If you want to avoid any of these side-effects of SAS’s pass-by-reference behavior, you can very easily do so: just don’t write any modules that modify input arguments. Always modify a copy of the variable instead. Try it out Can you predict what the output of this chunk will be? f &lt;- function(x) { f &lt;- function(x) { f &lt;- function(x) { x ^ 2 } f(x) + 1 } f(x) * 2 } f(10) Run it - were you right? What happens when you run a similar program in SAS? (I only nested two functions this time, but you get the idea) proc IML; start f(x); start f(x); return x**x; finish; return f(x)+1; finish; quit; Working through the R program: This gets much less confusing if you rename the functions following R’s scoping rules. f &lt;- function(x) { f1 &lt;- function(x) { # because inside of f(), the new definition will dominate f2 &lt;- function(x) { # because inside of f1(), the new definition will dominate x ^ 2 } f2(x) + 1 } f1(x) * 2 } f(10) Once this has been renamed, it is relatively easy to write out as a series of mathematical substitutions: \\[f(10) = f1(10) * 2 = (f2(10) + 1) * 2 = (10^2 + 1)*2 = 202\\] Running the similar program in SAS results in SAS complaining about a recursive function definition. What will this SAS program output? proc IML; start funwithSAS(x, y); a = x; x = x + 3; return x*y; finish; a = 0; res1 = funwithSAS(a, 5); a1 = a; x = 3; res2 = funwithSAS(x, 5); a2 = a; x2 = x; y = 3; res3 = funwithSAS(x, y); /* print res1 a1 res2 a2 x2 res3 a x y; */ /* uncomment this when you&#39;re ready */ quit; This is easiest if we step through the program and list what is passed around inside and outside of the function evaluation. a = 0 res1 = ...? (inside funwithsas res1) x = (location of a), y = 5 (inside funwithsas res1) a = x = (location of a), x = (location of a) + 3 = 3, so (location of a) = 3 and x = 3. res1 returns x = 3 * y = 5 = 15 a1 = 3 res2 = ...? (inside funwithsas res2) x = (location of x), y = 5 (inside funwithsas res2) a = (location of x), x = (location of x) + 3 = 6 (a outside the function is unaffected because a is not a parameter) res2 returns x = 6 * y = 5 = 30 a2 = 3 x2 = 6 y = 3 res3 = ...? (inside funwithsas res3) x = (location of x), y = (location of y) (inside funwithsas res3) a = (location of x), x = (location of x) + 3 = 9 (a outside the function is unaffected; y is unchanged) res3 returns x = 9 * y = 3 = 27 at this point, x = 9 and y = 3. So the output is res1 = 15 a1 = 3 res2 = 30 a2 = 3 x2 = 6 res3 = 27 a = 3 x = 9 y = 3 The trick to this problem is to realize that inside of the function, when a variable is passed in (by reference) the thing that is assigned is the pointer to the value in memory where the original variable lives. So when a is passed in as x, x is assigned (location of a), which is then assigned to the local copy of a. So both variables now point at the outside (a), and any changes to x also affect both a and the local copy of a. 3.3.2 Infix operators and the pipe in R Note You do not need to understand the collapsed section below. If you’re feeling comfortable with the material, go ahead and read it now. I’ve left it in the functions section, because it’s a topic relating to functions, but it’s not essential to understand to use R (even at an advanced level)8. Infix operators Most functions take arguments written after the function name. Can you think of any functions which work differently? Infix functions are functions that take arguments on both sides of the function name. Say, a + b: technically, a and b are arguments to the function +, so we could think of this as +(a, b). R has a number of infix functions, but you can also create your own. User-defined infix functions start and end with %. So %&gt;%, %in%, %dosomething% would all be valid infix operators. To define one, you need to enclose the name in back-ticks (`). `%dosomething%` &lt;- function(a, b) { a^b - a + b } 3 %dosomething% 4 [1] 82 You can also call default infix operators using this syntax: `+`(3, 4) = 7 One of the most useful infix operators is the pipe, %&gt;%, which is a part of the magrittr library and is commonly included in other packages, such as dplyr, and tidyr (we will talk about packages later in this chapter, but pipes are useful to discuss now, so roll with it for a few minutes). The one part of this section that is important to at least be able to use is the pipe: %&gt;%. There is an entire chapter dedicated to discussing the pipe in R4DS, including a discussion of when not to use the pipe. library(magrittr) 3 %&gt;% exp() [1] 20.08554 exp(3) [1] 20.08554 The pipe takes the left hand side and a function, and puts the left hand side as an argument to the function on the right hand side. It doesn’t sound very impressive, but it allows you to do a very cool thing: “chain” operations. Consider 3 functions: f1 &lt;- function(x, y = 3) { x * y } f2 &lt;- function(z) { z^2 } f3 &lt;- function(z2) { log10(z2) } Normally, you’d write f3(f2(f1(4))), which you have to read from the inside to the outside if you want to describe what this function call is doing. With pipes, you can write the same operation as: 4 %&gt;% f1() %&gt;% f2() %&gt;% f3() [1] 2.158362 This is much simpler to read - it’s like a recipe. “Take 4, do f1, then f2, then f3”. You don’t need to know how to define your own infix operators, but you will want to become familiar with the pipe. It’s a central component of writing “tidy” R code. Incidentally, SAS also has a use for the pipe: leveraging the operating system to work with files. In SAS, you just use the keyword pipe, which is hopefully pretty obvious. 3.4 Scripts Up until this point, you may have been writing code in an R Studio or SAS text editor window, or, you may have been typing commands into the command line without preserving them in a separate file. You might even have been working in R markdown documents, where you had code and non-code chunks of the file. A script is a file which contains only code and comments. It is intended to run from start to finish, and usually completes one or more tasks - for instance, cleaning your data, or loading a series of custom functions into your R environment. Scripts are useful because they preserve code so that it can be re-run… and in some cases, they can even be re-run autonomously - I have several scripts which automatically run at specific times every day to complete various tasks (scraping data off the internet, mostly). I find that when doing data analysis, it is often easier to write a script as opposed to working in R markdown or typing commands into the console. Scripts are a record of what I’ve done, and ensure that commands are executed in the right order. As with any tool, it is important to know where to use the tool and where the tool is usually not the best option. You can source (run) an R script using the source() command with the file path of the script as the argument. Scripts in R end in .r or .R, while scripts in SAS end in .sas. Scripts can be run in one of (at least) two modes: batch mode, or interactive mode. In batch mode, the entire script is run without human intervention or monitoring. This is useful for repetitive jobs – for instance, to record the weather at 6h intervals throughout the day. In interactive mode, scripts may be run line-by-line or block-wise, with small tweaks made to the code as you proceed through the file. I find that in some cases, what starts out as an interactive mode script can become a batch script as I work the kinks out. If you ever need to use the high-performance computing resources on campus, you will need to write code to run in batch mode, because these jobs are generally not friendly to interactive programming. Try it out I maintain a list of packages that I find to be useful so that when I install R on a new machine (or update R), I don’t have to spend 3 weeks realizing that I need to install X package. Instead of many repeated 5 minute pauses for package installation, I can just let this script run once and walk away. I’ve pared down my list of packages a bit for this class (you don’t need the packages for analysis of 3D bullet scan data, for instance), but this step should help populate your R installation with a few new packages. Read the script (located here) and try to understand what it is doing. Once you think you understand what it is doing, run the following command to run the script and install the packages on your machine. Were you right? source(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/code/03_setup.R&quot;) 3.5 Packages and Modules Both SAS and R have systems for extending the base system/language with additional functionality. In R, these extensions are called packages. In SAS, language extensions are called modules (for things sold by SAS), macros (for functions distributed by users), and in packages (which exist but are rarely used).9 3.5.1 R In R, there are two main sources for packages: CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) (and related archives, such as MRAN, which is Microsoft’s version of CRAN) and github. R packages published on CRAN go through a basic verification process that makes sure that the package meets certain standards (for instance, packages must have proper dependencies specified, cannot conflict with previous package names, must have a software license, and cannot contain malicious code). Note that CRAN does not check the packages for statistical correctness! On github, packages go through less verification. Many packages use a system where the version in development is on github and available for installation, but the version on CRAN is considered “stable”. Sometimes, packages are never put on CRAN: I contribute to several packages which are too large for CRAN, and it’s not worth the hassle to get an exception or figure out a workaround. library(rvest) txt &lt;- read_xml(&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/&quot;) %&gt;% html_node(css = &quot;#pkgs&quot;) %&gt;% xml_parent() %&gt;% html_text() npkgs &lt;- stringr::str_extract(txt, &quot;features \\\\d{1,}&quot;) %&gt;% stringr::str_remove(&quot;features &quot;) %&gt;% as.numeric() Currently, the CRAN package repository features 1.580110^{4} available packages. How do you navigate them to find the one you need? Sometimes, the CRAN Task Views may be helpful - for instance, if you want to see all of the packages which are useful for Meta-Analysis, Finance, Bayesian statistics, etc. Other times, it’s useful to let Google help you navigate: searching for “R CRAN” + “what you want the package to do” can often narrow things down (I recommend adding CRAN in because Google results for “R” are not particularly useful.) 3.5.2 SAS In SAS, there are also packages of code that encapsulate scripts. However, unlike R (and many other languages), there is no centralized repository for SAS packages. Papers may include SAS packages to demonstrate new methods, and other packages may be found on GitHub or various SAS forums. A more common way of distributing code in SAS seems to be through the use of single-file macros. (Even longtime SAS users don’t necessarily know about the package system). These macros often need to be slightly customized to your environment (or you need to customize your environment to match the assumptions made in the macro, which can be harder). 3.6 References A more advanced take on functions in R can be found here (Advanced R chapter) There is also a handy cheat sheet style summary of PROC IML in SAS here and some useful demonstrations of simple tasks in IML here. A helpful blog post for scoping in SAS is here Here is another explanation of pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference (intended for C programming) A comparison of R, SAS, and python - source of information about the SAS package distribution system. if you’re familiar with C, the argument passed in is just a pointer to the original memory↩ I had been using R for ~8 years before I ever heard the term “infix operator” - and I’d been using infix operators for a long time at that point, just without thinking about what they were.↩ Note that the various components of SAS can be extremely confusing to separate.

For the moment, we’ll focus on tabular data - data that is stored in a rectangular shape, with rows indicating observations and columns that show variables. This type of data can be stored on the computer in multiple ways: as raw text, usually in a file that ends with .txt, .tsv, .csv, .dat, or sometimes, there will be no file extension at all. These types of files are human-readable. If part of a text file gets corrupted, the rest of the file may be recoverable. in a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets, such as those created by MS Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc, are not completely binary formats, but they’re also not raw text files either. They’re a hybrid. Practically, they may function like a poorly laid-out database, a text file, or a total nightmare, depending on who designed the spreadsheet. There is a collection of horror stories here and a series of even more horrifying tweets here as a binary file. Binary files are compressed files that are readable by computers but not by humans. They generally take less space to store on disk (but the same amount of space when read into computer memory). If part of a binary file is corrupted, the entire file is usually affected. R, SAS, Stata, SPSS, and Minitab all have their own formats for storing binary data. Packages such as foreign in R will let you read data from other programs, and packages such as haven in R will let you write data into binary formats used by other programs. To read data from R into SAS, the easiest way is probably to call R from PROC IML. Here is a very thorough explanation of why binary file formats exist, and why they’re not necessarily optimal. in a database. Databases are typically composed of a set of one or more tables, with information that may be related across tables. Data stored in a database may be easier to access, and may not require that the entire data set be stored in computer memory at the same time, but you may have to join several tables together to get the full set of data you want to work with. There are, of course, many other non-tabular data formats – some open and easy to work with, some inpenetrable. A few which may be more common: Web related data structures: XML (eXtensible markup language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), YAML. These structures have their own formats and field delimiters, but more importantly, are not necessarily easily converted to tabular structures. They are, however, useful for handling nested objects, such as trees. When read into R or SAS, these file formats are usually treated as lists, and may be restructured afterwards into a format useful for statistical analysis. Spatial files: Shapefiles are by far the most common version of spatial files10. Spatial files often include structured encodings of geographic information plus corresponding tabular format data that goes with the geographic information. We’ll explore these a bit more when we talk about maps. To be minimally functional in R and SAS, it’s important to know how to read in text files (CSV, tab-delimited, etc.). It can be helpful to also know how to read in XLSX files. We will briefly cover binary files and databases, but it is less critical to remember how to read these in without consulting one or more online references. 4.2 Text Files There are several different variants of text data which are relatively common, but for the most part, text data files can be broken down into fixed-width and delimited formats. What’s the difference, you say? 4.2.1 Fixed-width files In a fixed-width text file, the position of the data indicates which field (variable/column) it belongs to. These files are fairly common outputs from older FORTRAN-based programs, but may be found elsewhere as well - if you have a very large amount of data, a fixed-width format may be more efficient to read, because you can select only the portions of the file which matter for a particular analysis (and so you don’t have to read the whole thing into memory). Col1 Col2 Col3 3.4 4.2 5.4 27.3 -2.4 15.9 In base R (no extra packages), you can read fwf files in using read.fwf, but you must specify the column breaks yourself. ## url &lt;-

to use. Tibbles also do not have the problems with factors (see the introduction to factors) - they will always read characters in as characters. library(readr) # Better data importing in R read_table(url, skip = 2) # Gosh, that was much easier! # A tibble: 121 x 24 STID STNM TIME RELH TAIR WSPD WVEC WDIR WDSD WSSD WMAX RAIN PRES &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 ACME 110 0 53 31.8 5.2 5.1 146 8.5 0.7 6.9 0 965. 2 ADAX 1 0 55 32.4 1 0.8 108 36.5 0.4 2.2 0 976. 3 ALTU 2 0 31 35.6 8.9 8.7 147 10.9 1.1 11.5 0 961. 4 ALV2 116 0 27 35.8 6.7 6.7 145 8.2 1.2 9 0 957. 5 ANT2 135 0 73 27.8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 990. 6 APAC 111 0 52 32.3 6.2 6.1 133 9.8 0.8 7.9 0 960. 7 ARD2 126 0 46 32.9 2.6 2.5 150 11.8 0.5 3.6 0 979. 8 ARNE 6 0 28 33.5 6.5 6.3 163 11.9 1.5 10 0 927. 9 BEAV 8 0 23 34.9 11.2 11.1 165 7.3 1.4 15.2 0 921. 10 BESS 9 0 37 33.8 8.3 8.3 156 6.6 1.3 11.2 0 951. # … with 111 more rows, and 11 more variables: SRAD &lt;dbl&gt;, TA9M &lt;dbl&gt;, # WS2M &lt;dbl&gt;, TS10 &lt;dbl&gt;, TB10 &lt;dbl&gt;, TS05 &lt;dbl&gt;, TS25 &lt;dbl&gt;, TS60 &lt;dbl&gt;, # TR05 &lt;dbl&gt;, TR25 &lt;dbl&gt;, TR60 &lt;dbl&gt; You can also write fixed-width files if you really want to: if (!&quot;gdata&quot; %in% installed.packages()) install.packages(&quot;gdata&quot;) library(gdata) write.fwf(mtcars, file = &quot;data/04_mtcars-fixed-width.txt&quot;) In SAS, it’s a bit more complicated, but not that much - the biggest difference is that you generally have to specify the column names for SAS.

In theory you can also get SAS to write out a fixed-width file, but it’s much easier to just… not. You can generally use a CSV or format of your choice – and you should definitely do that, because delimited files are much easier to work with. 4.2.2 Delimited Text Files Delimited text files are files where fields are separated by a specific character, such as &quot; “,”,&quot;, tab, etc. Often, delimited text files will have the column names as the first row in the file. As long as you know the delimiter, it’s pretty easy to read in data from these files in R using the readr package. url &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shahinrostami/pokemon_dataset/master/pokemon_gen_1_to_8.csv&quot; pokemon_info &lt;- read_csv(url) Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X1&#39; [1] Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_double(), name = col_character(), german_name = col_character(), japanese_name = col_character(), status = col_character(), species = col_character(), type_1 = col_character(), type_2 = col_character(), ability_1 = col_character(), ability_2 = col_character(), ability_hidden = col_character(), growth_rate = col_character(), egg_type_1 = col_character(), egg_type_2 = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. pokemon_info[1:6, 1:6] # Show only the first 6 lines &amp; cols # A tibble: 6 x 6 X1 pokedex_number name german_name japanese_name generation &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 1 Bulbasaur Bisasam フシギダネ (Fushigidane)… 1 2 1 2 Ivysaur Bisaknosp フシギソウ (Fushigisou)… 1 3 2 3 Venusaur Bisaflor フシギバナ (Fushigibana)… 1 4 3 3 Mega Venusa… Bisaflor フシギバナ (Fushigibana)… 1 5 4 4 Charmander Glumanda ヒトカゲ (Hitokage) 1 6 5 5 Charmeleon Glutexo リザード (Lizardo) 1 # a file delimited with | url &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/data/NE_Features_20200501.txt&quot; nebraska_locations &lt;- read_delim(url, delim = &quot;|&quot;) Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_character(), FEATURE_ID = col_double(), PRIM_LAT_DEC = col_double(), PRIM_LONG_DEC = col_double(), SOURCE_LAT_DEC = col_double(), SOURCE_LONG_DEC = col_double(), ELEV_IN_M = col_double(), ELEV_IN_FT = col_double() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. nebraska_locations[1:6, 1:6] # A tibble: 6 x 6 FEATURE_ID FEATURE_NAME FEATURE_CLASS STATE_ALPHA STATE_NUMERIC COUNTY_NAME &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 171013 Peetz Table Area CO 08 Logan 2 171029 Sidney Draw Valley NE 31 Cheyenne 3 182687 Highline Canal Canal CO 08 Sedgwick 4 182688 Cottonwood Cre… Stream CO 08 Sedgwick 5 182689 Sand Draw Valley CO 08 Sedgwick 6 182690 Sedgwick Draw Valley CO 08 Sedgwick You can also read in the same files using read.csv and read.delim, which are the equivalent base R functions. url &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shahinrostami/pokemon_dataset/master/pokemon_gen_1_to_8.csv&quot; pokemon_info &lt;- read.csv(url, header = T, stringsAsFactors = F) pokemon_info[1:6, 1:6] # Show only the first 6 lines &amp; cols X pokedex_number name german_name japanese_name 1 0 1 Bulbasaur Bisasam フシギダネ (Fushigidane) 2 1 2 Ivysaur Bisaknosp フシギソウ (Fushigisou) 3 2 3 Venusaur Bisaflor フシギバナ (Fushigibana) 4 3 3 Mega Venusaur Bisaflor フシギバナ (Fushigibana) 5 4 4 Charmander Glumanda ヒトカゲ (Hitokage) 6 5 5 Charmeleon Glutexo リザード (Lizardo) generation 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 # a file delimited with | url &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/data/NE_Features_20200501.txt&quot; nebraska_locations &lt;- read.delim(url, sep = &quot;|&quot;, header = T) nebraska_locations[1:6, 1:6] FEATURE_ID FEATURE_NAME FEATURE_CLASS STATE_ALPHA STATE_NUMERIC 1 171013 Peetz Table Area CO 8 2 171029 Sidney Draw Valley NE 31 3 182687 Highline Canal Canal CO 8 4 182688 Cottonwood Creek Stream CO 8 5 182689 Sand Draw Valley CO 8 6 182690 Sedgwick Draw Valley CO 8 COUNTY_NAME 1 Logan 2 Cheyenne 3 Sedgwick 4 Sedgwick 5 Sedgwick 6 Sedgwick SAS also has procs to accommodate CSV and other delimited files. PROC IMPORT may be the simplest way to do this, but of course a DATA step will work as well. We do have to tell SAS to treat the data file as a UTF-8 file (because of the japanese characters). Don’t know what UTF-8 is? Watch this excellent YouTube video explaining the history of file encoding! While writing this code, I got an error of “Invalid logical name” because originally the filename was pokemonloc. Let this be a friendly reminder that your dataset names in SAS are limited to 8 characters in SAS. Note Note: Due to UTF-8 issues, this code chunk runs (with complaints) when I paste it into SAS, but does not run in bookdown. The complaints are because there are column names that are not valid SAS names (presumably, SAS doesn’t allow UTF-8 characters as column names). /* x &quot;curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shahinrostami/pokemon_dataset/master/pokemon_gen_1_to_8.csv &gt; ~/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/pokemon.csv&quot;; only run this once to download the file... */ filename pokeloc &#39;~/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/pokemon.csv&#39; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;; proc import datafile = pokeloc out=poke DBMS = csv; /* comma delimited file */ GETNAMES = YES ; proc print data=poke (obs=10); /* print the first 10 observations */ run; The only abnormal thing is that on my computer, the japanese characters don’t render.

There are many other packages with different features, however - I have used openxlsx in the past to format spreadsheets to send to clients, for instance. By far and away you are more likely to have problems with the arcane format of the Excel spreadsheet than with the package used to read the data in. It is usually helpful to open the spreadsheet up in Excel or LibreOffice first to make sure the formatting is as you expected it to be. if (!&quot;readxl&quot; %in% installed.packages()) install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;) library(readxl) path &lt;- &quot;~/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/police_violence.xlsx&quot; if (!file.exists(path)) download.file(&quot;https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/s/MPVDatasetDownload.xlsx&quot;, path, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) police_violence &lt;- read_xlsx(&quot;data/police_violence.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1) police_violence[1:10, 1:6] # A tibble: 10 x 6 `Victim&#39;s name` `Victim&#39;s age` `Victim&#39;s gende… `Victim&#39;s race` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Eric M.

In this code chunk, we have to handle the fact that one of the columns in the spreadsheet contains dates. SAS and Excel handle dates a bit differently, so we have to transform the date variable – and we may as well relabel it at the same time. To do this, we use a DATA statement that outputs to the same dataset it references. We define a new variable date, adjust the Excel dates so that they conform to SAS’s standard, and tell SAS how to format the date. (We’ll talk more about dates and times later) libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; PROC IMPORT OUT=classdat.police DATAFILE=&quot;~/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/police_violence.xlsx&quot; DBMS=xlsx /* Tell SAS what type of file it&#39;s reading */ REPLACE; /* replace the dataset if it already exists */ SHEET=&quot;2013-2019 Police Killings&quot;; /* SAS reads the first sheet by default */ GETNAMES=yes; informat VAR6 mmddyy10.; /* tell SAS what format the date is in */ RUN; DATA classdat.police; SET classdat.police; /* modify the dataset and write back out to it */ date = VAR6 - 21916; /* Conversion to SAS date standard from Excel */ FORMAT date MMDDYY10.; /* Tell SAS how to format the data when printing it */ DROP VAR6; /* Get rid of the original data */ num_age = INPUT(Victim_s_age, 3.); /* create numeric age variable */ DROP A_brief_description_of_the_circu URL_of_image_of_victim Link_to_news_article_or_photo_of; /* drop longer variable to save space so the file fits on GitHub */ /* Size went from 100 MB to 6.7 MB without these 3 vars */ RUN; PROC PRINT DATA=classdat.police (obs=10); /* print the first 10 observations */ VAR Victim_s_name Victim_s_age num_age Victim_s_gender Victim_s_race date; RUN; Obs Victim_s_name Victim_s_age num_age Victim_s_gender Victim_s_race date 1 Eric M.

In general, it is better to avoid working in Excel, as it is not easy to reproduce the results (and Excel is horrible about dates and times, among other issues). Saving your data in more reproducible formats will make writing reproducible code much easier. Try it out The Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles publishes a database of vehicle registrations by type of license plate. Link Read that data in using both R and SAS. Be sure to look at the structure of the excel file, so that you can read the data in properly! url &lt;- &quot;https://dmv.nebraska.gov/sites/dmv.nebraska.gov/files/doc/2019_Veh_Reg_by_Plate_Type.xlsx&quot; download.file(url, destfile = &quot;data/2019_Vehicle_Registration_Plates_NE.xlsx&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) library(readxl) ne_plates &lt;- read_xlsx(path = &quot;data/2019_Vehicle_Registration_Plates_NE.xlsx&quot;, skip = 1) New names: * County -&gt; County...1 * County -&gt; County...34 ne_plates[1:10,1:6] # A tibble: 10 x 6 County...1 `Amateur\\r\\nRad… `Apport-\\r\\nion… `Apport\\r\\nTrlr` AC &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 C01 - DOU… 148 0 0 10 2 C02 - LAN… 244 0 0 2 3 C03 - GAGE 10 0 0 1 4 C04 - CUS… 6 0 0 0 5 C05 - DOD… 28 0 0 0 6 C06 - SAU… 18 0 0 0 7 C07 - MAD… 19 0 0 0 8 C08 - HALL 16 0 0 0 9 C09 - BUF… 26 0 0 2 10 C10 - PLA… 12 0 0 2 # … with 1 more variable: `Breast\\r\\nCancer` &lt;dbl&gt; PROC IMPORT OUT=WORK.licplate DATAFILE=&quot;~/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/2019_Vehicle_Registration_Plates_NE.xlsx&quot; DBMS=xlsx /* Tell SAS what type of file it&#39;s reading */ REPLACE; /* replace the dataset if it already exists */ RANGE=&quot;&#39;Reg By Plate Type&#39;$A2:0&quot; GETNAMES=yes; RUN; /* just a few columns... way too many to handle */ PROC PRINT DATA=WORK.licplate (obs=10); /* print the first 10 observations */ Var County Amateur__Radio Breast__Cancer Choose__Life County__Gov Comm__Truck Passenger Total; RUN; Obs County Amateur__Radio Breast__Cancer Choose__Life County__Gov Comm__Truck Passenger TOTAL 1 C01 - DOUGLAS 148 957 584 1432 71296 313694 467720 2 C02 - LANCASTER 244 802 540 649 44031 164391 275088 3 C03 - GAGE 10 47 17 135 6153 12839 32484 4 C04 - CUSTER 6 13 5 218 2684 6312 22154 5 C05 - DODGE 28 86 32 92 8907 21248 45040 6 C06 - SAUNDERS 18 65 55 225 6019 13372 34531 7 C07 - MADISON 19 88 47 197 9308 19776 44478 8 C08 - HALL 16 136 59 212 15177 35270 72244 9 C09 - BUFFALO 26 79 46 206 12354 27235 61208 10 C10 - PLATTE 12 77 62 186 9437 20137 47551 4.4 Binary Files Both R and SAS have binary data files that store data in a more compact form. It is relatively common for government websites, in particular, to provide SAS data in binary form. Luckily, it is possible to read the binary data files in both programs. Let’s read in the data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey: libname classdat &quot;~/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data&quot;; /* this tells SAS where to look for (a bunch of) data files */ proc contents data=classdat.cen10pub; /* This tells sas to access the specific file */ run; Data Set Name CLASSDAT.CEN10PUB Observations 150147 Member Type DATA Variables 8 Engine V9 Indexes 0 Created 06/30/2014 12:35:56 Observation Length 25 Last Modified 06/30/2014 12:35:56 Deleted Observations 0 Protection Compressed NO Data Set Type Sorted NO Label Data Representation WINDOWS_32 Encoding wlatin1 Western (Windows) Engine/Host Dependent Information Data Set Page Size 4096 Number of Data Set Pages 928 First Data Page 1 Max Obs per Page 162 Obs in First Data Page 75 Number of Data Set Repairs 0 Filename /home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/cen10pub.sas7bdat Release Created 9.0202M2 Host Created W32_VSPRO Inode Number 39064453 Access Permission rw-rw-r– Owner Name susan File Size 4MB File Size (bytes) 3802112 Alphabetic List of Variables and Attributes # Variable Type Len Format Informat Label 5 CBSACAT10 Char 2 CBSA category for the HH home address 4 CBSASIZE10 Char 2 CBSA (2010) population size for the HH home address 2 HH_CBSA10 Char 5 \\(CHAR5.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td class=&quot;l data&quot;&gt;\\)CHAR5.

For now, it’s enough that we can see roughly how it’s structured. There are theoretically ways to read R data into SAS via the R subsystem. Feel free to do that on your own machine.11 In R, there are a couple of different binary files. .Rdata is perhaps the most common, and can store several objects (along with their names) in the same file. legos &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/lego_sets.csv&quot;) Parsed with column specification: cols( set_num = col_character(), name = col_character(), year = col_double(), theme_id = col_double(), num_parts = col_double() ) my_var &lt;- &quot;This variable contains a string&quot; save(legos, my_var, file = &quot;data/R_binary.Rdata&quot;) If we look at the file sizes of lego_sets.csv (619 KB) and R_binary.Rdata(227.8 KB), the size difference between binary and flat file formats is obvious. We can load the R binary file back in using the load() function. rm(legos, my_var) # clear the files out ls() # all objects in the working environment [1] &quot;%dosomething%&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;adder&quot; [4] &quot;basel_value&quot; &quot;breaks&quot; &quot;circle_area&quot; [7] &quot;crust_ingredients&quot; &quot;current_value&quot; &quot;data&quot; [10] &quot;decimal&quot; &quot;df&quot; &quot;dist&quot; [13] &quot;dog&quot; &quot;essential_toppings&quot; &quot;f1&quot; [16] &quot;f2&quot; &quot;f3&quot; &quot;grocery_list&quot; [19] &quot;i&quot; &quot;ick&quot; &quot;integer&quot; [22] &quot;logical&quot; &quot;m3&quot; &quot;m3or5&quot; [25] &quot;m5&quot; &quot;mat&quot; &quot;math_and_lsd&quot; [28] &quot;mesodata&quot; &quot;mesodata_names&quot; &quot;minv&quot; [31] &quot;month_fct&quot; &quot;mtcars&quot; &quot;myfun&quot; [34] &quot;myfun2&quot; &quot;myfun3&quot; &quot;ne_plates&quot; [37] &quot;nebraska_locations&quot; &quot;npkgs&quot; &quot;path&quot; [40] &quot;pokemon_info&quot; &quot;police_violence&quot; &quot;prev_basel_value&quot; [43] &quot;prev_value&quot; &quot;sasopts&quot; &quot;saspath&quot; [46] &quot;state_facts&quot; &quot;state.abb&quot; &quot;state.area&quot; [49] &quot;state.center&quot; &quot;state.division&quot; &quot;state.name&quot; [52] &quot;state.region&quot; &quot;state.x77&quot; &quot;string&quot; [55] &quot;tmp&quot; &quot;tmp_ascii&quot; &quot;tmp_chars&quot; [58] &quot;tmp_chars_space&quot; &quot;tmp_space&quot; &quot;txt&quot; [61] &quot;url&quot; &quot;w&quot; &quot;widths&quot; [64] &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; &quot;y_mag&quot; [67] &quot;y_sign&quot; &quot;yfact&quot; &quot;yummy_toppings&quot; [70] &quot;z&quot; load(&quot;data/R_binary.Rdata&quot;) ls() # all objects in the working environment [1] &quot;%dosomething%&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;adder&quot; [4] &quot;basel_value&quot; &quot;breaks&quot; &quot;circle_area&quot; [7] &quot;crust_ingredients&quot; &quot;current_value&quot; &quot;data&quot; [10] &quot;decimal&quot; &quot;df&quot; &quot;dist&quot; [13] &quot;dog&quot; &quot;essential_toppings&quot; &quot;f1&quot; [16] &quot;f2&quot; &quot;f3&quot; &quot;grocery_list&quot; [19] &quot;i&quot; &quot;ick&quot; &quot;integer&quot; [22] &quot;legos&quot; &quot;logical&quot; &quot;m3&quot; [25] &quot;m3or5&quot; &quot;m5&quot; &quot;mat&quot; [28] &quot;math_and_lsd&quot; &quot;mesodata&quot; &quot;mesodata_names&quot; [31] &quot;minv&quot; &quot;month_fct&quot; &quot;mtcars&quot; [34] &quot;my_var&quot; &quot;myfun&quot; &quot;myfun2&quot; [37] &quot;myfun3&quot; &quot;ne_plates&quot; &quot;nebraska_locations&quot; [40] &quot;npkgs&quot; &quot;path&quot; &quot;pokemon_info&quot; [43] &quot;police_violence&quot; &quot;prev_basel_value&quot; &quot;prev_value&quot; [46] &quot;sasopts&quot; &quot;saspath&quot; &quot;state_facts&quot; [49] &quot;state.abb&quot; &quot;state.area&quot; &quot;state.center&quot; [52] &quot;state.division&quot; &quot;state.name&quot; &quot;state.region&quot; [55] &quot;state.x77&quot; &quot;string&quot; &quot;tmp&quot; [58] &quot;tmp_ascii&quot; &quot;tmp_chars&quot; &quot;tmp_chars_space&quot; [61] &quot;tmp_space&quot; &quot;txt&quot; &quot;url&quot; [64] &quot;w&quot; &quot;widths&quot; &quot;x&quot; [67] &quot;y&quot; &quot;y_mag&quot; &quot;y_sign&quot; [70] &quot;yfact&quot; &quot;yummy_toppings&quot; &quot;z&quot; Another (less common) binary format used in R is the RDS format. Unlike Rdata, the RDS format does not save the object name - it only saves its contents. As a result, when you read from an RDS file, you need to store the result of that function into a variable. saveRDS(legos, &quot;data/RDSlego.rds&quot;) other_lego &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/RDSlego.rds&quot;) Because RDS formats don’t save the object name, you can be sure that you’re not over-writing some object in your workspace by loading a different file. The downside to this is that you have to save each object to its own RDS file separately. Try it out Read in two of the files from an earlier example, and save the results as an Rdata file with two objects. Then save each one as an RDS file. In RStudio, go to Session -&gt; Clear Workspace. (This will clear your environment) Now, using your RDS files, load the objects back into R with different names. Finally, load your Rdata file. Are the two objects the same? (You can actually test this with all.equal() if you’re curious) library(readxl) police_violence &lt;- read_xlsx(&quot;data/police_violence.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1, guess_max = 7000) police_violence2 &lt;- read_xlsx(&quot;data/police_violence.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 2, guess_max = 7000) save(police_violence, police_violence2, file = &quot;data/04_Try_Binary.Rdata&quot;) saveRDS(police_violence, &quot;data/04_Try_Binary1.rds&quot;) saveRDS(police_violence2, &quot;data/04_Try_Binary2.rds&quot;) rm(police_violence, police_violence2) # Limited clearing of workspace... pv1 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/04_Try_Binary1.rds&quot;) pv2 &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/04_Try_Binary2.rds&quot;) load(&quot;data/04_Try_Binary.Rdata&quot;) all.equal(police_violence, pv1) [1] TRUE all.equal(police_violence2, pv2) [1] TRUE 4.5 Databases There are many different database formats. Some of the most common databases are SQL* related formats and Microsoft Access files. This excellent GitHub repo contains code to connect to multiple types of databases in R, python, PHP, Java, SAS, and VBA 4.5.1 Microsoft Access In R, we can read in MS Access files using the Hmisc package, as long as the mdbtools library is available on your computer12.

cannot attest their depositions. Makghie nominated to witness their confessions before commission can be requested. Note about re-examining the suspects in order to confirm their depositions. Once this had been done commission was to be requested. 3 Commission issued after accused had confessed to some aspect of witchcraft but PC urged the commissioners not to use torture and to ensure that the accused are mentally and legally competent to stand trial. 4 Commission for trial but the accused was to be legally and mentally competent to stand trial. 5 Commission issued after accused had confessed but PC urged caution about use of torture. The accusedwas to confess voluntarily and be of legal and mental competency to stand trial. 6 Commission issued after the accused had confessed. 7 Commission issued after the accused had confessed. 8 Commission issued after the accused had confessed. 9 Commission issued after the accused had confessed. 10 Commission issued, accused already imprisoned. 11 Accused imprisoned before commission issued. 12 Commission issued after the accused was imprisoned. 13 14 Commission issued after the accused was imprisoned. 15 Commission issued after the accused was imprisoned. 16 Commission issued after the accused was imprisoned. 17 Accused recorded as having confessed before commission issued. 18 Commission appears to have been issued after the accused confessed. 19 Commission issued after the accused had confessed. 20 Commission issued after the accused had confessed. 21 It seems that she may have been released as there is no further reference to trial or outome. 22 The accused petitioned PC about illegal pricking by John Dick, who was ordered to be arrested and questioned. Second petition requested public announcement of his innocence as he claimed Dick&#39;s actions had brought &#39;infamie and disgrace&#39; on him. He did not have a trial but PC cleared his name. 23 Commission for trial, suspect imprisoned. Commission to report to PC before sentence. 24 Deposition attested and request for commission to try and judge the suspect recorded in presbytery records. 25 Accused petitioned PC about her imprisonment.

Suspect appears to have been quite high status and reference to a local bound court suggests desire to keep the trial within local control with no reference to central authorities. 55 Presbytery notes that deposition from accused had been attested and therefore commission for trial and judge was to be requested. 56 57 58 Bailies of the Canongate to proceed to trial without torture. 59 Died after being pricked by John Ramsay. 60 Accused appealed to PC that she had been held in prison for 18 months.

The person who consulted her also seems to have been punished as well. 67 Local ministers and lairds (?elders) involved. Reported that the accused confessed in her local kirk. Investigation went on for some months and several ministers involved. Found guilty of charming but appears that they could not sentence her to death for this. Presbytery recorded that a commission was to be requested. 20/7/1642 Mr John Currie reported that the council felt the points of the application in &#39;no wayes demerit death&#39;, ?no further action. 68 deposition attested and commission for trial and judge to be requested. 69 No details apart from minister was to make some investigations. 70 Brother and husband requested that she was set at liberty.

No details of accusations. 71 Local minister reported that he was investigating the suspect, but no further details. 72 Accused named by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) and presbytery arrest and investigate case. Commission granted and suspects pricked but nothing found against Moffat. Ordered to be released. Ministers had wanted Coutts to be brought to confront those she had named but this seems not to have happened, and this appears to be another example of Coutts&#39; naming without any cause. 73 Named by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) along with several others. Presbytery investigate and requested commission from Committee of Estates. There were some witnesses against McBirnie who accused her of causing harm but, after further investigation, case was dismissed. Birnie wanted Coutts brought to confront suspects but this appears not to have happened. 74 Accused was named, with several others, by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817). Local ministers investigated and commission requested from Committee of Estates. Janet Coutts was meant to be brought to confront the accused but this does not appear to have happened. Most of the other accused were dismissed but nothing was recorded about Acheson. 75 Presbytery and ministers investigated accusations made by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817). Commission applied for from committee of estates and accused imprisoned and pricked but case dismissed as no witnesses found against her. Coutts may have been brought to confront the accused but no record of this. 76 Suspect named by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) and local ministers investigated case. Commission from committee of estates granted and, although one witness appeared against Laidlaw, the case was dismissed. Coutts and Cathie seem to have had a double act as he was brought in to examine the suspects. Coutts may have been brought to confront them but no record of it. 77 Named by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817). Investigations made at local level and committee of estates applied to for commisison. Suspects examined by Cathie (who was working with Coutts) but evidence seems to have been non-existent. Hunter at one point confessed to demonic stuff but this appears not to have been enough to convict and case was dismissed. 78 Denounced by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) and presbytery investigated case. There seems to have been little evidence or witnesses apart from Coutts and Cathie the witch-pricker, although commission was granted. Case dismissed. 79 deposition attested and request for commission to try and judge to be made. 80 Denounced by Janet Coutts. George Cathie witch pricker involved. Presbytery investigated the case and got commission. After imprisonment and pricking there seems to have been insufficient evidence to pursue the suspects. Bessie Gibson is not recorded as having been released (as most of them were) but it is likely that she was too. 81 denounced by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) and case investigated by presbytery. Commission granted and suspects examined by Cathie the witch pricker, who seem to have a bit of a double act with Coutts. However the investigators did not come up with sufficient evidence and case dismissed. 82 Denounced by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) and case investigated by presbytery. Commission granted and suspects imprisoned and pricked. However there appears to have been no witnesses apart from Coutts and George Cathie, the pricker, and the case was dismissed. 83 denounced by Janet Coutts (C/EGD/1817) and the presbytery investigated the case. Commission applied for and granted, suspects imprisoned and pricked but apart from Coutts&#39; accusation and the evidence of Cathie, the pricker, there appears to have been no other evidence or witnesses and case was dismissed. 84 Suspects were being &#39;interviewed&#39; by ministers in the following months. 85 The suspects were being questioned and interviewed by ministers during the following months. 86 The suspects were questioned and interviewed by ministers over the following months. 87 Suspects were questioned and interviewed by ministers over the following months. 88 Presbytery note that they recommend applying to the Privy Council for a commission, but no evidence if this was received. 89 Deposition attested and request for commission to try and judge to be made. 90 Presbytery involved in investigations. Ordered prayer and fasting with the victim, Christian Shaw, and that an account of her sufferings be recorded by Turner and Brisbane, 2 ministers. The commission was read out on 18/3/1697 in Renfrew. This case was under a PC commission (see PC1/51 p. 136-9) along with most of the people tried at the same time. There were other Renfrewshire witchcraft suspects tried at different places and times. I am keeping this as a mixed/central local because the Privy Council maintained very strict control over the proceedings, even though they granted a commission. For details of the proceedings of Privy Council in this matter see the no named witches case c/la/3235. 91 She was one of a number accused of bewitching Christian Shaw. Note in presbytery that the suspects were held in the houses of several of the ministers. The commission was read out in the burgh of Renfrew 18/3/1697. This case was under a PC commission (see PC1/51 p. 136-9) along with most of the people tried at the same time. There were other Renfrewshire witchcraft suspects tried at different places and times.

This case was under a PC commission (see PC1/51 p. 136-9) along with most of the people tried at the same time. There were other Renfrewshire witchcraft suspects tried at different places and times. I am keeping this as a mixed/central local because the Privy Council maintained very strict control over the proceedings, even though they granted a commission. For details of the proceedings of Privy Council in this matter see the no named witches case c/la/3235. 93 One of several people accused by Christian Shaw of bewitching her. Suspect held in the houses of the local ministers. He was determined to be a witness not a suspect due to young age. He was mentioned in the Privy Council commission but wasn&#39;t tried with that group. 94 She was originally part of the 1697 Renfrewshire witches, but she was not tried at that time due to pregnancy. She was confined to Edinburgh by the Privy council on 6 Sept. 1698. (joyce notes) I think this is mixed trial as presbytery note that committee of justiciary was due to travel through to the west in 4/1699. JC references imply that there was supposed to be a trial in Glasgow in May 1699. 95 Presbytery investigated but no further proceedings. 96 Presbytery note that the details were to be sent to the judge competent in order to get a commission. Later, 29/1/1650, referred to burgh magistrates who were to approach Privy Council. 97 Presbytery note that commission to be requested from Privy Council after she was referred to burgh council 98 Presbytery note that they advised the magistrate about the suspect, and later note that they recommend requesting a commission. 99 deposition attested and commission for trial and judge to be requested. 100 Presbytery note that they advised the magistrate about the suspects and later that they recommend applying for a commission. 101 Presbytery note that the suspect was to be recommended to the &#39;judge ordinair&#39; after she had confessed witchcraft. 102 Presbytery note that the accused had confessed to witchcraft and they recommend referring her to the &#39;judge ordinair&#39;. 103 Presbytery note that they recommend referring details to the &#39;judge competent&#39;.

Note that commission obtained, 11/3/1696. Also notes that she accused other people but no names mentioned. The Privy Council handed the whole matter over to his majesty&#39;s Advocate due to irregularities in the handling of the commission. 110 Presbytery note that the accused was to be imprisoned in Balliemore and to appear at the next provincial presbytery meeting. No further details recorded in the minutes. 111 Deposition attested and commission to try and judge to be requested. 112 The presbytery investigated the accusations, which were raised by another woman. The other witnesses all denied the charges or were vague about just what had happened and the charges were dropped.

The accuser had to make public repentance for raising the scandal. 114 Recorded in presbytery records as having confessed to witchcraft but not to pact. Named others. Reported to have died of sickness. 115 Presbytery minutes show that the accused (and others) were imprisoned and ministers sent to encourage their confession. The records also referred to a commission granted from parliament. There are 2 commissions granted from parliament in 1649 that refer to Inverkeithing witches, APS, vol VI, part 2, pp, 463 and 538, so presumably she was part of these general commissions for un-specified or un-named individuals. 116 The presbytery notes recorded that the accused (and others) was imprisoned and ministers were to visit and encourage them to confess. The records also referred to a commission granted by parliament. There are two references to commissions that included people from Inverkeithing, APS, vol vi, part 2, pp. 463 and 538, so presumable she was included in these general commissions for un-specified individuals. She complained to the Committee of Estates about being arrested and kept in stocks in the steeple. The Committee of Estates ordered her to be moved to better accommodation and that her husband was to have free access to see her and that no torture or &#39;hard usage&#39; be put to her. They also ordered the presbytery of Dunfermline to send all its probation against her to the committee for review by 11/9/1649. On 13/9/ 1649 the presbytery presented evidence that the original complaint (given in by her husband) had been &#39;calumnious&#39; and she had bribed the watch and escaped but was recaptured and held at Burntisland where they found the Devil&#39;s mark. The presbytery was praised for their diligence and her husband was fined. 117 The presbytery minutes noted that the accused was imprisoned (with others) and ministers were to visit to encourage them to confess. The minutes also referred to a commission from parliament.

The minutes record that the brethren had heard nothing proven against her that merited death and so she was to be brought before the presbytery and dismissed. 129 Presbytery interviewed witnesses and ordered that accused was warded to await further trial. 130 Presbytery minutes recorded that witnesses were interviewed about accusations against MD over several months. By 20/7/1650 the brethren decided that the accusations against her were not proven. 131 Presbytery minutes recorded that the suspect was questioned but denied all charges. As they found no grounds to put her to an assize they released her on caution. 132 The presbytery minutes record that they think they have enough grounds to apprehend her. 133 134 135 Interviewed but refused to confess.

Referred the case back to (?provincial) assembly or synod for advice. 168 Davidson was accused by 4 people (2 married couples) of being a witch. She denied the accusations, which seem vague, and presbytery allowed her to call witnesses to support her counter claim of slander. There seems to have been a disagreement between her and one of the other women. No further action appears to have been taken. 169 Presbytery appear to have considered the accusation and called both parties to appear with witnesses. Later entry records that James Annand (her accuser) was absolved from accusation of slander. 170 Deposition attested.

A rather harrowing description of how they were investigated and treated in prison. 1352 Husband appealed to presbytery for her release on 7/8/1644 - refused. She again sought release on 11/9/1644 but the minister convinced the Privy Council to give him 20 days to get complaints against her. No complaints came in, so she was ordered released. She was originally denounced by someone. 1353 1354 1355 1356 1357 1358 1359 1360 1361 1362 1363 1364 She was summoned for questioning after being denounced in a nearby parish.

The session ordered her to abstain from all charming. [Somewhere along the line, the accusations of charming turned into witchcraft.] 1379 1380 1381 1382 1383 1384 1385 1386 1387 1388 1389 1390 1391 Seems to have been examined by the Privy Council 9/4/1591 where he confessed and said it was all at the instigation of Bothwell. April 1591, King James VI ordered Maitland to make sure Grahame got his ordinary allowance. Graham conveyed a verbal complaint about his mistreatment in prison to a the Master of Wark who wrote it down and delivered it to the King. Graham said he was promised better conditions in ward and a servant. 1392 1393 1394 1395 She was orginally arrested in 1651. Also, it seems that a former provost and two former bailies tried to exonerate her and the three other arrested with her (7 October 1651). There is some evidence of a commission being granted that was not acted upon (from 13 July 1652). 1396 She was orginally arrested in 1651. Also, it seems that a former provost and two former bailies tried to exonerate her and the three other arrested with her (7 October 1651).

There is some evidence of a commission being granted that was not acted upon (from 13/7/1652). 1398 Appears to have been investigated in 1656 by Dumfries presbytery. No details from Kirkcudbright as the presbytery records start too late, but no specific action taken/punishment. 1399 1400 Accused of trying to bribe a minister of Ayr after she was challenged before the Session for witchcraft. 1401 1402 She confessed to her minister. The suspects were interrogated in their parishes, referred to the Presbytery and then the JPs asked the presbytery to present their susptects to the JPs for trial. 1403 1404 The suspects were interrogated in their parishes, referred to the presbytery and then the JPs asked the presbytery to present the suspects to the JPs for trial. 1405 The suspects were interrogated in their parishes, referred to the presbytery and then the JPs asked the presbytery to present their suspects to the JPs for trial. 1406 She confessed to healing with deeds, but denied using any words. 1407 confessed to charming, but denied witchcraft 1408 She was denounced to the minister by a neighbour. 1409 She confessed. She said that the Devil told her to drown herself but a man rescued her from the water. 1410 1411 Depositions taken on 25/2/1659 at Stirling court. 1412 Depositions taken on 25/2/1659 at Stirling court. 1413 1414 1415 1416 1417 1418 1419 1420 He got a commission but refused to put her to trial, just held her in prison. John Home, minister told her husband that she should pretend to be with bairn. She was released into his custody and re-arrested. Her case was reviewed by the Archbishop of Glasgow before going to the Privy Council. 1421 1422 She was listed as interrogated in 8/1651 1423 1424 1425 1426 1427 1428 1429 1430 1431 1432 1433 1434 1435 1436 1437 1438 1439 1440 1441 1442 1443 This case was under a Privy Council commission (see PC1/51 p. 136-9) along with most of the people tried at the same time. There were other Renfrewshire witchcraft suspects tried at different places and times. I am keeping this as a mixed/central local because the Privy Council maintained very strict control over the proceedings, even though they granted a commission. For details of the proceedings of Privy Council in this matter see the no named witches case c/la/3235. He was not tried with the rest of the group. 1444 1445 He was interrogated by the Privy Council until he confessed and named his sisters and others. 1446 1447 1448 1449 1450 1451 1452 1453 1454 1455 1456 1457 1458 1459 1460 1461 1462 1463 1464 1465 1466 1467 1468 1469 1470 1471 1472 1473 1474 1475 1476 1477 1478 1479 1480 1481 1482 1483 1484 1485 1486 1487 1488 1489 1490 1491 1492 1493 she was questioned before a committee of the Presbytery of Ayr 1494 Her confession was read in Dumfries on the dittay roll. 1495 The Provost of Kircudbright testified against her. She was investigated before the Kirk Session and the JPs on 4/5/1658. 1496 1497 She had been previously censured by the Kirk. She was confronted by Janet Miller a confessing witch who had denounced her. Witness statements were collected on 4/5/1658. Witnesses were summond on 31/3/1659 to appear at her trial. 1498 1499 She was interrogated by JPs on 19/5/1658. 1500 1501 Also mention of a commission granted by the committee of estates for the trial of witches? The date is for 20/3/1659. 1502 1503 1504 witness statements were collected on 4/5/1658 1505 1506 1507 1508 1509 1510 1511 1512 1513 The corpse bleedingordeal was conducted unofficially. Witness statements were given on 23, 30 April 1671, 7 May 1671 and 13/5/1671. Janet Callen has supposedly lived with Elspeth before Callen was charged and executed for witchcraft. On 2 May 1671 she was summond to appear at Dumfries on 12 May 1671 for her trial. 1514 Witnesses called on 3 May 1671 for her trial to be held on 12 May 1671. On 16 April 1671 she was summond to appear for trial in Dumfries. 1515 She was on a fugitive roll at some point. 1516 She was described as delinquent, I think that means that she did not appear when summond. 1517 1518 1519 1520 1521 1522 1523 1524 1525 1526 1527 1528 1529 1530 1531 1532 1533 She was accused of being pressured and tortured to falsely accuse someone sometime in 1677 or 1678. 1534 She was tortured, tormented and arrested illegally by 3 men (a bailie and two others) on May 1678. The came to her house in the night with pistols and drawn swords, but she was saved by others. 1535 She was accused of being pressured and tortured to falsely accuse someone sometime in 1677 or 1678.

Case carried over to next day. I found another order for central justiciary trial dated 13/2/1629. On 22 Jan 1629 the trial date was set for 15 days. 1273 1274 1275 1276 1277 1278 The indictment and trial information were in the register of Privy Council. The trial was prosecuted by the procurator fiscal. 1279 the prosecutor was the procurator fiscal. The indictment and trial information were in the register of Privy Council 1280 1281 ordered to report back to the PC for sentencing. 1282 report back to Privy Council for sentencing 1283 1284 1285 1286 1287 It was referred to the Jusiciar of Ayr from the court of Justiciary in Edinburgh. 1288 Prosecutor was the procurator fiscal. Found her guilty of only 3 of the charges. No record of the sentence. I think she was set free because she had a second trial three years later. The assize found her guilty, but the Judge absolved her. 1289 the only document we have is a brief report of the Elgin trial&#39;s findings to the Privy Council for direction as to sentencing. 31/1/1643 the Privy Council has a note &#39;the report of the processe of a witche in Murray to be advysit.&#39; no mention of their advice. 1290 procurator fiscal was the prosecutor. Other new, charges were brought. 1291 1292 1293 1294 1295 1296 1297 1298 1299 1300 1301 1302 1303 1304 1305 1306 1307 1308 1309 1310 1311 1312 1313 1314 1315 1316 1317 1318 11/2/1634-continuance for trial due to bad weather, witnesses and assize could not get to Edinburgh for the trial. 11/3/1634 the defence asked for a continuance because they hadn&#39;t yet seen the dittay. More strict adherence to rules of evidence than normal. Very detailed defence pleadings 1319 1320 1321 1322 1323 1324 1325 1326 1327 1328 1329 1330 1331 1332 1333 1334 1335 1336 1337 1338 1339 1340 1341 1342 1343 1344 1345 the sentence was to be the ordinary sentence. 1346 1347 1348 1349 1350 It is difficult to determine exactly what happened. She appears to have been tried in Culross, then moved to Edinburgh where the Lord Advocate maybe oversaw her trial. 1351 There was a trial at Culross, but the the procurator did not continue with the trial, but he also didn&#39;t release them. Mention of a trial happening at 28/8/1644 as well, but possibly just her mother? 1352 1353 1354 1355 1356 1357 1358 1359 1360 1361 1362 1363 she was found guilty of charming, but still executed 1364 1365 1366 1367 1368 1369 1370 1371 1372 1373 1374 1375 1376 1377 1378 1379 She was tried earlier and banished, but refused to leave. She was banished from Birsay parish. Not clear what kind of court heard the first &#39;trial&#39;, but appears that she voluntarily said she would leave in exchange for droppign the charges. 1380 1381 1382 1383 Diet was deserted by order of the Privy Council, and she was remitted to be tried in the place from which she came. 1384 1385 1386 1387 1388 1389 1390 1391 1392 Not guilty because the assize found no malefice 1393 1394 referred to the Justice of the Peace 1395 On two porteous rolls on 31 March 1658 summond to appear on 6 April 1658. 1396 On two porteous rolls on 31 March 1658 summond to appear on 6 April 1658.

&#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 1673 rows ] Many databases have multiple tables with keys that connect information in each table. We’ll spend more time on databases later in the semester - for now, it’s enough to be able to get data out of one. Unfortunately, it appears that SAS on Linux doesn’t allow you to read in Access files. So I can’t demonstrate that for you. But, since you know how to do it in R, worst case you can open up R and export all of the tables to separate CSV files, then read those into SAS. emo::ji(&quot;sad&quot;) 4.5.2 SQLite SQLite databases are contained in single files with the extension .SQLite. These files can still contain many different tables, though. Let’s try working with a sqlite file that has only one table: if (!&quot;RSQLite&quot; %in% installed.packages()) install.packages(&quot;RSQLite&quot;) if (!&quot;DBI&quot; %in% installed.packages()) install.packages(&quot;DBI&quot;) library(RSQLite) library(DBI) con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), &quot;data/ssa-babynames-for-2015.sqlite&quot;) dbListTables(con) # List all the tables [1] &quot;babynames&quot; babyname &lt;- dbReadTable(con, &quot;babynames&quot;) head(babyname, 10) # show the first 10 obs state year name sex count rank_within_sex per_100k_within_sex 1 AK 2015 Olivia F 56 1 2367.9 2 AK 2015 Liam M 53 1 1590.6 3 AK 2015 Emma F 49 2 2071.9 4 AK 2015 Noah M 46 2 1380.6 5 AK 2015 Aurora F 46 3 1945.0 6 AK 2015 James M 45 3 1350.5 7 AK 2015 Amelia F 39 4 1649.0 8 AK 2015 Ava F 39 4 1649.0 9 AK 2015 William M 44 4 1320.5 10 AK 2015 Oliver M 41 5 1230.5 You can of course write formal queries using the DBI package, but for many databases, it’s easier to do the querying in R. We’ll cover both options later - the R version will be in the next module. In SAS, you can theoretically connect to SQLite databases, but there are very specific instructions for how to do that for each operating system. You’ll need to acquire the SQLite ODBC Driver for your operating system. You may also need to set up a DSN (Data Source Name) (Windows, Mac and Linux).13 Here is my .odbc.ini file as I’ve configured it for my Ubuntu 18.04 machine. A similar file should work for any Mac or Linux machine. In windows, you’ll need to use the ODBC Data Source Administrator to set this up.

EDA is important because it helps us to know what challenges a particular data set might bring. Real data is often messy, with large amounts of cleaning that must be done before statistical analysis can commence. While in many classes you’ll be given cleaner data, you do need to know how to clean your own data up so that you can use more interesting datasets for projects (and for fun!). The EDA chapter in R for Data Science is very good at explaining what the goals of EDA are, and what types of questions you will typically need to answer in EDA. It is so good that I am not going to try to completely reproduce it here. Both R and SAS make it relatively easy to get summary statistics from a dataset, but the “flow” of EDA is somewhat different between the two programs, so this section will cover SAS first, and then R. 4.6.1 SAS Proc Freq generates frequency tables for variables or interactions of variables. This can help you to see whether there is missing information. Using those frequency tables, you can create frequency plots and set up chi squared tests. libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; ODS GRAPHICS ON; PROC FREQ DATA=classdat.poke ORDER=FORMATTED; TABLES generation / CHISQ PLOTS=freqplot(type=dotplot); RUN; PROC FREQ DATA=classdat.poke ORDER=FREQ; TABLES type_1 status / MAXLEVELS=10 PLOTS=freqplot(type=dotplot scale=percent); RUN; ODS GRAPHICS OFF; generation Frequency Percent Cumulative Frequency Cumulative Percent 1 192 18.68 192 18.68 2 107 10.41 299 29.09 3 165 16.05 464 45.14 4 121 11.77 585 56.91 5 171 16.63 756 73.54 6 85 8.27 841 81.81 7 99 9.63 940 91.44 8 88 8.56 1028 100.00 Chi-Square Testfor Equal Proportions Chi-Square 94.1012 DF 7 Pr &gt; ChiSq &lt;.0001 Sample Size = 1028 type_1 Frequency Percent Cumulative Frequency Cumulative Percent Water 134 13.04 134 13.04 Normal 115 11.19 249 24.22 Grass 91 8.85 340 33.07 Bug 81 7.88 421 40.95 Psychic 76 7.39 497 48.35 Fire 65 6.32 562 54.67 Electric 61 5.93 623 60.60 Rock 60 5.84 683 66.44 Dark 44 4.28 727 70.72 Ghost 41 3.99 768 74.71 The first 10 levels are displayed. status Frequency Percent Cumulative Frequency Cumulative Percent Normal 915 89.01 915 89.01 Sub Legendary 45 4.38 960 93.39 Legendary 39 3.79 999 97.18 Mythical 29 2.82 1028 100.00 Proc Means can be used to get more useful summary statistics for numeric variables.

It contains histograms on the diagonal, and pairwise scatterplots on off-diagonals. It can be useful for spotting strong correlations among multiple variables which may affect the way you build a model. Try it out One of the datasets we read in above records incidents of police violence around the country. Explore the variables present in this dataset (see code in the spreadsheets section to read it in). Note that some variables may be too messy to handle with the things that you have seen thus far - that is ok. As you find irregularities, document them - these are things you may need to clean up in the dataset before you conduct a formal analysis. It is useful to memorize the SAS PROC options you use most frequently, but it’s also a good idea to reference the SAS documentation - it provides a list of all viable options for each procedure, and generally has decent examples to show how those options are used. libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; ODS GRAPHICS ON; PROC CONTENTS DATA = classdat.police; /* see what&#39;s in the dataset */ RUN; PROC FREQ DATA = classdat.police ORDER=FREQ; /* Examine Freq of common vars */ TABLES Victim_s_gender Victim_s_race State Cause_of_death Unarmed Geography__via_Trulia_methodolog / MAXLEVELS = 10; RUN; PROC FREQ DATA = classdat.police ORDER=FREQ; /* Combinations of vars */ TABLES Unarmed * Criminal_Charges_ / NOCUM NOPERCENT NOCOL NOROW MAXLEVELS=10; RUN; PROC MEANS DATA = classdat.police; /* Numeric variable exploration */ VAR num_age; /* Only numeric variable in this set */ RUN; PROC UNIVARIATE DATA = classdat.police; /* Investigating age/date info */ HISTOGRAM num_age date; RUN; ODS GRAPHICS OFF; Data Set Name CLASSDAT.POLICE Observations 7663 Member Type DATA Variables 25 Engine V9 Indexes 0 Created 06/17/2020 17:51:08 Observation Length 896 Last Modified 06/17/2020 17:51:08 Deleted Observations 0 Protection Compressed NO Data Set Type Sorted NO Label Data Representation SOLARIS_X86_64, LINUX_X86_64, ALPHA_TRU64, LINUX_IA64 Encoding latin1 Western (ISO) Engine/Host Dependent Information Data Set Page Size 73728 Number of Data Set Pages 94 First Data Page 1 Max Obs per Page 82 Obs in First Data Page 75 Number of Data Set Repairs 0 Filename /home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/police.sas7bdat Release Created 9.0401M6 Host Created Linux Inode Number 39068552 Access Permission rw-rw-r– Owner Name susan File Size 7MB File Size (bytes) 7004160 Alphabetic List of Variables and Attributes # Variable Type Len Format Informat Label 10 Agency_responsible_for_death Char 177 $177. $177.

Also, varying capitalizations… - Geography - #N/A should be recoded as missing - Criminal_Charges_ - What does No/NO mean? (would need to look up in the codebook) - Age - the maximum age recorded is 107, which bears some investigation… other extreme observations between 89 and 95 are also fairly interesting and could be investigated further. There are also several infants/young children included, which is horribly sad, but believable. - Date - PROC UNIVARIATE doesn’t display date results with a meaningful format, even though format is specified. - Conclusions (ok, probably obvious before this analysis): - It’s much more likely for charges to be filed if the suspect was unarmed (but still very rare) - Data is relatively evenly distributed between 2013 and 2019. - It’s fairly rare for police to kill female or transgender individuals - around 5% of all victims - California, Texas, and Florida, while populous, seem to have a disproportionate number of killings, especially compared to e.g. NY, which is also a high population state. To really make the state numbers meaningful, though, we’d need to know population counts. There’s also an issue of accurate comparisons - some states may not report police killings with the same standards as other states. 4.6.2 R In SAS, EDA is fairly straightforward - you use specific procedures for each data type, and the plots which may be most useful come along with those procedures. It’s something like ordering off of a menu of pre-defined meals, and then slightly customizing your order. In R, you put your whole order together from the a la carte menu. That is, R will give you all of the same summary information (and possibly more), but you have to assemble a series of commands to get each portion. This can be more efficient (since you don’t have to wade through pages of output to get the piece you want) but may take a bit more coding as well. In this section, I will mostly be using the plot commands that come with base R and require no extra packages. The R for Data Science book shows plot commands which use the ggplot2 library. We will learn this library later in this class - it produces beautiful plots - and if you want to use it at this point, you may. It requires a bit more thought as to how to specify the plot, though, which may not be desireable. The first, and most basic EDA command in R is summary(). For numeric variables, summary provides 5-number summaries plus the mean. For categorical variables, summary provides the length of the variable and the Class and Mode. For factors, summary provides a table of the most common values, as well as a catch-all “other” category. library(readr) url &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shahinrostami/pokemon_dataset/master/pokemon_gen_1_to_8.csv&quot; poke &lt;- read_csv(url) Warning: Missing column names filled in: &#39;X1&#39; [1] Parsed with column specification: cols( .default = col_double(), name = col_character(), german_name = col_character(), japanese_name = col_character(), status = col_character(), species = col_character(), type_1 = col_character(), type_2 = col_character(), ability_1 = col_character(), ability_2 = col_character(), ability_hidden = col_character(), growth_rate = col_character(), egg_type_1 = col_character(), egg_type_2 = col_character() ) See spec(...) for full column specifications. #

If we do not specify breaks, R will pick them for us. hist(poke$generation) # This isn&#39;t really optimal... we only have whole numbers. hist(poke$generation, breaks = 0:8) # Much better. For continuous variables, we can use histograms, or we can examine kernel density plots. Remember that %&gt;% is the “pipe” and takes the left side of the pipe to pass as an argument to the right side. This makes code easier to read because it becomes a step-wise “recipe”. library(magrittr) # This provides the pipe command, %&gt;% hist(poke$weight_kg) poke$weight_kg %&gt;% log10() %&gt;% # Take the log - will transformation be useful w/ modeling? hist() # create a histogram poke$weight_kg %&gt;% density(na.rm = T) %&gt;% # First, we compute the kernel density # (na.rm = T says to ignore NA values) plot() # Then, we plot the result poke$weight_kg %&gt;% log10() %&gt;% # Transform the variable density(na.rm = T) %&gt;% # Compute the density ignoring missing values plot(main = &quot;Density of Log10 pokemon weight in Kg&quot;) # Plot the result, # changing the title of the plot to a meaningful value We may also want to look at correlations between variables. In R, most models are specified as y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, where the information on the left side of the tilde is the dependent variable, and the information on the right side are any explanatory variables. Interactions are specified using x1*x2 to get all combinations of x1 and x2 (x1, x2, x1*x2); single interaction terms are specified as e.g. x1:x2 and do not include any component terms. To examine the relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable, we might look at boxplots: boxplot(log10(height_m) ~ status, data = poke) boxplot(total_points ~ species, data = poke) In the second boxplot, there are far too many categories to be able to resolve the relationship clearly, but the plot is still effective in that we can identify that there are one or two species which have a much higher point range than other species. EDA isn’t usually about creating pretty plots (or we’d be using ggplot right now) but rather about identifying things which may come up in the analysis later. To look at the relationship between numeric variables, we could compute a numeric correlation, but a plot is more useful: plot(defense ~ attack, data = poke, type = &quot;p&quot;) cor(poke$defense, poke$attack) [1] 0.4507656 Sometimes, we discover that a variable which appears to be continuous is actually relatively quantized - there are only a few values of base_friendship in the whole dataset. plot(x = poke$base_experience, y = poke$base_friendship, type = &quot;p&quot;) A scatterplot matrix can also be a useful way to visualize relationships between several variables. pairs(poke[,19:23]) # hp - sp_defense columns There’s more information on how to customize these plots here. Try it out Explore the variables present in the police violence data (see code in the spreadsheets section to read it in). Note that some variables may be too messy to handle with the things that you have seen thus far - that is ok. As you find irregularities, document them - these are things you may need to clean up in the dataset before you conduct a formal analysis.

And examine the age range for each gender as well: police_violence %&gt;% boxplot(`Victim&#39;s age` ~ `Victim&#39;s gender`, data = .) The thing I’m honestly most surprised at with this plot is that there are so many elderly individuals (of both genders) shot. That’s not a realization I’d normally construct this plot for, but the visual emphasis on the outliers in a boxplot makes it much easier to focus on that aspect of the data. My analysis in R was a bit more free-form than in SAS - in SAS, I proceeded fairly directly through each procedure, while in R, I could investigate things that caught my eye along the way more easily. I didn’t focus as much on what we’d need to clean up in R (because the same problems exist that we identified when using SAS). 4.7 References Reading JSON in SAS – You know SAS documentation is getting weird when they advertise a method as “the sexiest way to import JSON data into SAS”.

In this section, we’re going to start out by learning how to work with data. Generally speaking, data doesn’t come in a form suitable for analysis - you have to clean it up, create the variables you care about, get rid of those you don’t care about, and so on. In R, we’ll be using the tidyverse for this. It’s a meta-package (a package that just loads other packages) that [collects packages designed with the same philosophy15 and interface (basically, the commands will use predictable argument names and structure). You’ve already been introduced to the tidyverse - specifically, readr. In SAS, there is no tidyverse, but there is a relatively consistent structure for how to accomplish each task. Most data cleaning in SAS is accomplished in data steps. In the interests of not confusing terms too much between languages, I’m going to use the tidyverse “verbs” to describe operations in both SAS and R. dplyr (one of the packages in the tidyverse) creates a “grammar of data manipulation” to make it easier to describe different operations. I find the dplyr grammar to be extremely useful when talking about data operations, so I’m going to attempt to show you how to do the same operations in R with dplyr, and in SAS (without the underlying framework). Each verb describes a common task when doing both exploratory data analysis and more formal statistical modeling. There is an excellent dplyr cheatsheet available from RStudio. You may want to print it out to have a copy to reference as you work through this chapter. 5.1 Tidy Data There are infinitely many ways to configure “messy” data, but data that is “tidy” has 3 attributes: Each variable has its own column Each observation has its own row Each value has its own cell We’ll get more into how to work with different “messy” data configurations in the next module, but it’s worth keeping rules 1 and 3 in mind while working through this module. 5.2 Filter: Pick cases (rows) based on their values Filter allows us to work with a subset of a larger data frame, keeping only the rows we’re interested in. We provide one or more logical conditions, and only those rows which meet the logical conditions are returned from filter(). Note that unless we store the result from filter() in the original object, we don’t change the original. Let’s explore how it works, using the starwars dataset, which contains a comprehensive list of the characters in the Star Wars movies. Data set up This data set is included in the dplyr package, so we load that package and then use the data() function to load dataset into memory. The loading isn’t complete until we actually use the dataset though… so let’s print the first few rows. library(dplyr) data(starwars) starwars # A tibble: 87 x 14 name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex gender &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Luke… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… 2 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… 3 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, bl… red 33 none mascu… 4 Dart… 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… 5 Leia… 150 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… 6 Owen… 178 120 brown, gr… light blue 52 male mascu… 7 Beru… 165 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… 8 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white, red red NA none mascu… 9 Bigg… 183 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… 10 Obi-… 182 77 auburn, w… fair blue-gray 57 male mascu… # … with 77 more rows, and 5 more variables: homeworld &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, # films &lt;list&gt;, vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt; In the interests of demonstrating the process on the same data, I’ve exported the starwars data to a CSV file using the readr package. I had to remove the list-columns (films, vehicles, starships) because that format isn’t supported by SAS. You can access the csv data here. Note that I exported the data using ‘.’ as the NA/missing character so that it will be easy to read into SAS. readr::write_csv(starwars[,1:11], &quot;data/starwars.csv&quot;, na = &#39;.&#39;) Let’s set that data up first: libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; filename swdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/starwars.csv&quot;; PROC IMPORT DATAFILE = swdat OUT = classdat.starwars DBMS = CSV REPLACE; GETNAMES = YES; RUN; PROC PRINT DATA=classdat.starwars (obs=10); RUN; Obs name height mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year sex gender homeworld species 1 Luke Skywalker 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male masculine Tatooine Human 2 C-3PO 167 75 gold yellow 112 none masculine Tatooine Droid 3 R2-D2 96 32 white, blue red 33 none masculine Naboo Droid 4 Darth Vader 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male masculine Tatooine Human 5 Leia Organa 150 49 brown light brown 19 female feminine Alderaan Human 6 Owen Lars 178 120 brown, grey light blue 52 male masculine Tatooine Human 7 Beru Whitesun lars 165 75 brown light blue 47 female feminine Tatooine Human 8 R5-D4 97 32 white, red red . none masculine Tatooine Droid 9 Biggs Darklighter 183 84 black light brown 24 male masculine Tatooine Human 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi 182 77 auburn, white fair blue-gray 57 male masculine Stewjon Human If you want to directly load the SAS datafile, you can find it here Once the data is set up, using filter is actually very simple.

Multiple clauses can be connected using and, and compound statements can be grouped with parentheses. Demonstration of where in SAS Rather than output the whole data table (which would take up a lot of space), I’ve linked the log file from each chunk below the chunk. libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; /* SAS limits dataset names to 8 characters, which is super annoying. */ /* Sorry the names aren&#39;t descriptive... */ proc printto log=&quot;other/05-filter-1.log&quot; new; /* shows output log in bookdown */ DATA tmp1; /* this is the out dataset */ /* By not having a library attached, SAS places this in WORK */ /* It&#39;s a temporary dataset */ set classdat.starwars; where (species = &#39;Human&#39;); run; See the log file here libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; proc printto log=&quot;other/05-filter-2.log&quot; new; /* shows output log in bookdown */ DATA tmp2; set classdat.starwars; where (species = &#39;Human&#39;) and (homeworld = &#39;Tatooine&#39;); run; See the log file here Try it out Using the pokemon data, can you create a new data set or data frame (SAS and R, respectively) that has only water type pokemon?

You might want to keep only even rows, or only the first 10 rows in a table. filter(poke, (row_number() %% 2 == 0)) # A tibble: 514 x 49 pokedex_number name german_name generation status species type_number type_1 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 2 Ivys… Bisaknosp 1 Normal Seed P… 2 Grass 2 3 Mega… Bisaflor 1 Normal Seed P… 2 Grass 3 5 Char… Glutexo 1 Normal Flame … 1 Fire 4 6 Mega… Glurak 1 Normal Flame … 2 Fire 5 7 Squi… Schiggy 1 Normal Tiny T… 1 Water 6 9 Blas… Turtok 1 Normal Shellf… 1 Water 7 10 Cate… Raupy 1 Normal Worm P… 1 Bug 8 12 Butt… Smettbo 1 Normal Butter… 2 Bug 9 14 Kaku… Kokuna 1 Normal Cocoon… 2 Bug 10 15 Mega… Bibor 1 Normal Poison… 2 Bug # … with 504 more rows, and 41 more variables: type_2 &lt;chr&gt;, height_m &lt;dbl&gt;, # weight_kg &lt;dbl&gt;, abilities_number &lt;dbl&gt;, ability_1 &lt;chr&gt;, ability_2 &lt;chr&gt;, # ability_hidden &lt;chr&gt;, total_points &lt;dbl&gt;, hp &lt;dbl&gt;, attack &lt;dbl&gt;, # defense &lt;dbl&gt;, sp_attack &lt;dbl&gt;, sp_defense &lt;dbl&gt;, speed &lt;dbl&gt;, # catch_rate &lt;chr&gt;, base_friendship &lt;chr&gt;, base_experience &lt;chr&gt;, # growth_rate &lt;chr&gt;, egg_type_number &lt;dbl&gt;, egg_type_1 &lt;chr&gt;, # egg_type_2 &lt;chr&gt;, percentage_male &lt;chr&gt;, egg_cycles &lt;chr&gt;, # against_normal &lt;dbl&gt;, against_fire &lt;dbl&gt;, against_water &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_electric &lt;dbl&gt;, against_grass &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ice &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_fight &lt;dbl&gt;, against_poison &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ground &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_flying &lt;dbl&gt;, against_psychic &lt;dbl&gt;, against_bug &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_rock &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ghost &lt;dbl&gt;, against_dragon &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_dark &lt;dbl&gt;, against_steel &lt;dbl&gt;, against_fairy &lt;dbl&gt; # There are several pokemon who have multiple entries in the table, # so the pokedex_number doesn&#39;t line up with the row number. slice_max() - this will keep the top values of a specified variable. It’s like a filter statement, but it’s a shortcut built to handle a common task. You could write a filter statement that would do this, but it would take a lot more code. slice_max(poke, order_by = total_points, n = 5) %&gt;% arrange(desc(total_points)) # Sort decreasing # A tibble: 6 x 49 pokedex_number name german_name generation status species type_number type_1 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 890 Eter… . 8 Legen… Gigant… 2 Poison 2 150 Mega… Mewtu 1 Legen… Geneti… 2 Psych… 3 150 Mega… Mewtu 1 Legen… Geneti… 1 Psych… 4 384 Mega… Rayquaza 3 Legen… Sky Hi… 2 Dragon 5 382 Prim… Kyogre 3 Legen… Sea Ba… 1 Water 6 383 Prim… Groudon 3 Legen… Contin… 2 Ground # … with 41 more variables: type_2 &lt;chr&gt;, height_m &lt;dbl&gt;, weight_kg &lt;dbl&gt;, # abilities_number &lt;dbl&gt;, ability_1 &lt;chr&gt;, ability_2 &lt;chr&gt;, # ability_hidden &lt;chr&gt;, total_points &lt;dbl&gt;, hp &lt;dbl&gt;, attack &lt;dbl&gt;, # defense &lt;dbl&gt;, sp_attack &lt;dbl&gt;, sp_defense &lt;dbl&gt;, speed &lt;dbl&gt;, # catch_rate &lt;chr&gt;, base_friendship &lt;chr&gt;, base_experience &lt;chr&gt;, # growth_rate &lt;chr&gt;, egg_type_number &lt;dbl&gt;, egg_type_1 &lt;chr&gt;, # egg_type_2 &lt;chr&gt;, percentage_male &lt;chr&gt;, egg_cycles &lt;chr&gt;, # against_normal &lt;dbl&gt;, against_fire &lt;dbl&gt;, against_water &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_electric &lt;dbl&gt;, against_grass &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ice &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_fight &lt;dbl&gt;, against_poison &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ground &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_flying &lt;dbl&gt;, against_psychic &lt;dbl&gt;, against_bug &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_rock &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ghost &lt;dbl&gt;, against_dragon &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_dark &lt;dbl&gt;, against_steel &lt;dbl&gt;, against_fairy &lt;dbl&gt; By default, slice_max() returns values tied with the nth value as well, which is why our result has 6 rows. slice_max(poke, order_by = total_points, n = 5, with_ties = F) %&gt;% arrange(desc(total_points)) # Sort decreasing # A tibble: 5 x 49 pokedex_number name german_name generation status species type_number type_1 &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 890 Eter… . 8 Legen… Gigant… 2 Poison 2 150 Mega… Mewtu 1 Legen… Geneti… 2 Psych… 3 150 Mega… Mewtu 1 Legen… Geneti… 1 Psych… 4 384 Mega… Rayquaza 3 Legen… Sky Hi… 2 Dragon 5 382 Prim… Kyogre 3 Legen… Sea Ba… 1 Water # … with 41 more variables: type_2 &lt;chr&gt;, height_m &lt;dbl&gt;, weight_kg &lt;dbl&gt;, # abilities_number &lt;dbl&gt;, ability_1 &lt;chr&gt;, ability_2 &lt;chr&gt;, # ability_hidden &lt;chr&gt;, total_points &lt;dbl&gt;, hp &lt;dbl&gt;, attack &lt;dbl&gt;, # defense &lt;dbl&gt;, sp_attack &lt;dbl&gt;, sp_defense &lt;dbl&gt;, speed &lt;dbl&gt;, # catch_rate &lt;chr&gt;, base_friendship &lt;chr&gt;, base_experience &lt;chr&gt;, # growth_rate &lt;chr&gt;, egg_type_number &lt;dbl&gt;, egg_type_1 &lt;chr&gt;, # egg_type_2 &lt;chr&gt;, percentage_male &lt;chr&gt;, egg_cycles &lt;chr&gt;, # against_normal &lt;dbl&gt;, against_fire &lt;dbl&gt;, against_water &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_electric &lt;dbl&gt;, against_grass &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ice &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_fight &lt;dbl&gt;, against_poison &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ground &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_flying &lt;dbl&gt;, against_psychic &lt;dbl&gt;, against_bug &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_rock &lt;dbl&gt;, against_ghost &lt;dbl&gt;, against_dragon &lt;dbl&gt;, # against_dark &lt;dbl&gt;, against_steel &lt;dbl&gt;, against_fairy &lt;dbl&gt; In SAS, these same tasks require a bit more code. Keeping only certain rows in SAS In SAS, to use a variable, you have to define it in one data step, then make another data step in order to use that variable. But, like dplyr, SAS has a row number counter that we can use for this purpose. libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; DATA tmp; SET classdat.poke; rownum=_n_; /* SAS shorthand for row number */ RUN; DATA evenrow; SET WORK.tmp; WHERE MOD(rownum, 2) = 0; DROP rownum; /* ditch temp variable */ RUN; Top N values We’re going to want to use PROC SORT to get the data arranged before we take the top N values. According to this, we can’t use _n_ in a where statement, and the proposed solution isn’t reliable. So we’ll do it the long way. libname classdat &quot;/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/sas/&quot;; PROC SORT DATA = classdat.poke OUT = pokesort; BY descending total_points; RUN; DATA poken; SET WORK.pokesort; rownum = _n_; RUN; DATA poken; SET WORK.poken; WHERE rownum &lt;= 5; DROP rownum; RUN; PROC PRINT DATA = poken; VAR pokedex_number name status species type_1 total_points; RUN; Obs pokedex_number name status species type_1 total_points 1 890 Eternatus Eternamax Legendary Gigantic Pokemon Poison 1125 2 150 Mega Mewtwo X Legendary Genetic Pokemon Psychic 780 3 150 Mega Mewtwo Y Legendary Genetic Pokemon Psychic 780 4 384 Mega Rayquaza Legendary Sky High Pokemon Dragon 780 5 382 Primal Kyogre Legendary Sea Basin Pokemon Water 770 In both cases, the SAS statements required to perform the task require a WHERE clause, but also a few other statements to get things working. The equivalent base R code would be about the same (though tricky in different spots) - the thing that makes the tidyverse philosophy so addictive is that it makes these common, everyday tasks both easy and concise (that is, few lines of code are required). 5.3 Select: Pick columns Sometimes, we don’t want to work with a set of 50 variables when we’re only interested in 5. When that happens, we might be able to pick the variables we want by index (e.g. df[, c(1, 3, 5)], or VAR statements, but that can get tedious). In dplyr, the function to pick a few columns is select(). The syntax from the help file (?select) looks deceptively simple. select(.data, …) So as with just about every other tidyverse function, the first argument in a select statement is the data. After that, though, you can put just about anything that R can interpret. ... means something along the lines of “put in any additional arguments that make sense in context or might be passed on to other functions”. So what can go in there? An exhaustive list of ways to select variables in dplyr First, dplyr aims to work with standard R syntax, making it intuitive (and also, making it work with variable names instead of just variable indices).16 Most dplyr commands work with “bare” variable names - you don’t need to put the variable name in quotes to reference it. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but they’re very explicitly exceptions. var3:var5: select(df, var3:var5) will give you a data frame with columns var3, anything between var3 and var 5, and var5 !(&lt;set of variables&gt;) will give you any columns that aren’t in the set of variables in parentheses (&lt;set of vars 1&gt;) &amp; (&lt;set of vars 2&gt;) will give you any variables that are in both set 1 and set 2. (&lt;set of vars 1&gt;) | (&lt;set of vars 2&gt;) will give you any variables that are in either set 1 or set 2. c() combines sets of variables. dplyr also defines a lot of variable selection “helpers” that can be used inside select() statements. These statements work with bare column names (so you don’t have to put quotes around the column names when you use them). everything() matches all variables last_col() matches the last variable. last_col(offset = n) selects the n-th to last variable. starts_with(&quot;xyz&quot;) will match any columns with names that start with xyz. Similarly, ends_with() does exactly what you’d expect as well. contains(&quot;xyz&quot;) will match any columns with names containing the literal string “xyz”. Note, contains does not work with regular expressions (you don’t need to know what that means right now). matches(regex) takes a regular expression as an argument and returns all columns matching that expression. num_range(prefix, range) selects any columns that start with prefix and have numbers matching the provided numerical range. There are also selectors that deal with character vectors. These can be useful if you have a list of important variables and want to just keep those variables. all_of(char) matches all variable names in the character vector char. If one of the variables doesn’t exist, this will return an error. any_of(char) matches the contents of the character vector char, but does not throw an error if the variable doesn’t exist in the data set. There’s one final selector - where() applies a function to each variable and selects those for which the function returns TRUE. This provides a lot of flexibility and opportunity to be creative (but I’ve never actually needed to use it). Let’s try these selector functions out and see what we can accomplish! if (!&quot;nycflights13&quot; %in% installed.packages()) install.packages(&quot;nycflights13&quot;) library(nycflights13) data(flights) str(flights) tibble [336,776 × 19] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) $ year : int [1:336776] 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 2013 ... $ month : int [1:336776] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ day : int [1:336776] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ dep_time : int [1:336776] 517 533 542 544 554 554 555 557 557 558 ... $ sched_dep_time: int [1:336776] 515 529 540 545 600 558 600 600 600 600 ... $ dep_delay : num [1:336776] 2 4 2 -1 -6 -4 -5 -3 -3 -2 ... $ arr_time : int [1:336776] 830 850 923 1004 812 740 913 709 838 753 ... $ sched_arr_time: int [1:336776] 819 830 850 1022 837 728 854 723 846 745 ... $ arr_delay : num [1:336776] 11 20 33 -18 -25 12 19 -14 -8 8 ... $ carrier : chr [1:336776] &quot;UA&quot; &quot;UA&quot; &quot;AA&quot; &quot;B6&quot; ... $ flight : int [1:336776] 1545 1714 1141 725 461 1696 507 5708 79 301 ... $ tailnum : chr [1:336776] &quot;N14228&quot; &quot;N24211&quot; &quot;N619AA&quot; &quot;N804JB&quot; ... $ origin : chr [1:336776] &quot;EWR&quot; &quot;LGA&quot; &quot;JFK&quot; &quot;JFK&quot; ... $ dest : chr [1:336776] &quot;IAH&quot; &quot;IAH&quot; &quot;MIA&quot; &quot;BQN&quot; ... $ air_time : num [1:336776] 227 227 160 183 116 150 158 53 140 138 ... $ distance : num [1:336776] 1400 1416 1089 1576 762 ... $ hour : num [1:336776] 5 5 5 5 6 5 6 6 6 6 ... $ minute : num [1:336776] 15 29 40 45 0 58 0 0 0 0 ... $ time_hour : POSIXct[1:336776], format: &quot;2013-01-01 05:00:00&quot; &quot;2013-01-01 05:00:00&quot; ... We’ll start out with the nycflights13 package, which contains information on all flights that left a NYC airport to destinations in the US, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. You might want to try out your EDA skills from the previous module to see what you can find out about the dataset, before seeing how select() works. We could get a data frame of departure information for each flight: select(flights, flight, year:day, tailnum, origin, matches(&quot;dep&quot;)) # A tibble: 336,776 x 9 flight year month day tailnum origin dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1545 2013 1 1 N14228 EWR 517 515 2 2 1714 2013 1 1 N24211 LGA 533 529 4 3 1141 2013 1 1 N619AA JFK 542 540 2 4 725 2013 1 1 N804JB JFK 544 545 -1 5 461 2013 1 1 N668DN LGA 554 600 -6 6 1696 2013 1 1 N39463 EWR 554 558 -4 7 507 2013 1 1 N516JB EWR 555 600 -5 8 5708 2013 1 1 N829AS LGA 557 600 -3 9 79 2013 1 1 N593JB JFK 557 600 -3 10 301 2013 1 1 N3ALAA LGA 558 600 -2 # … with 336,766 more rows Perhaps we want the plane and flight ID information to be the first columns: flights %&gt;% select(carrier:dest, everything()) # A tibble: 336,776 x 19 carrier flight tailnum origin dest year month day dep_time sched_dep_time &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 UA 1545 N14228 EWR IAH 2013 1 1 517 515 2 UA 1714 N24211 LGA IAH 2013 1 1 533 529 3 AA 1141 N619AA JFK MIA 2013 1 1 542 540 4 B6 725 N804JB JFK BQN 2013 1 1 544 545 5 DL 461 N668DN LGA ATL 2013 1 1 554 600 6 UA 1696 N39463 EWR ORD 2013 1 1 554 558 7 B6 507 N516JB EWR FLL 2013 1 1 555 600 8 EV 5708 N829AS LGA IAD 2013 1 1 557 600 9 B6 79 N593JB JFK MCO 2013 1 1 557 600 10 AA 301 N3ALAA LGA ORD 2013 1 1 558 600 # … with 336,766 more rows, and 9 more variables: dep_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, # arr_time &lt;int&gt;, sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt;, arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, # distance &lt;dbl&gt;, hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; Note that everything() won’t duplicate columns you’ve already added.

Unfortunately, SAS doesn’t make column selection quite as easy. It’s still not hard, but it can be tedious. 5.4 Group By 5.5 Summarize The philosophy includes a preference for pipes, but this preference stems from the belief that code should be readable in the same way that text is readable.↩ It accomplishes this through the magic of quasiquotation, which we will not cover in this course because it’s basically witchcraft.↩ "],
