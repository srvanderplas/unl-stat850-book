# Data Transformations {#sec-data-transformations}

## Module Objectives {#module6-objectives .unnumbered}

Broadly, your objective while reading this chapter is to be able to identify datasets which have "messy" formats and determine a sequence of operations to transition the data into "tidy" format. To do this, you should be master the following concepts:

-   Determine what data format is necessary to generate a desired plot or statistical model
-   Join and split data columns using string operations
-   Understand the differences between "wide" and "long" format data and how to transition between the two structures
-   Understand relational data formats and how to use data joins to assemble data from multiple tables into a single table.

## Tidy and Messy Data

### Motivating Example

Consider the spreadsheet screenshot in @fig-human-readable.

![Spreadsheet intended for human consumption, from @mccallumBadDataHandbook2013 (Chapter 3)](images/data-transformations/Data-human-consumption.png){#fig-human-readable}

This spreadsheet shows New Zealand High School certificate achievement levels for a boys-only school. Typically, students would get level 1 in year 11, level 2 in year 12, and level 3 in year 13, but it is possible for students to gain multiple levels in a single year. This data is organized to show the number of students gaining each type of certification (broken out by gender) across each of the 3 years. There are many blank cells that provide ample space to see the data, and all of the necessary variables are represented: there are essentially three 2x3 tables showing the number of students attaining each NCEA level in each year of school. If all of the information is present in this table, is there really a problem? Perhaps not if the goal is just to display the data, but analyzing this data effectively, or plotting it in a way that is useful, requires some restructuring. @fig-machine-readable shows a restructured version of this data in a more compact rectangular format.

![Spreadsheet reorganized for data analysis](images/data-transformations/Data-machine-consumption.png){#fig-machine-readable}

In @fig-machine-readable, each column contains one variable: Year, gender, level, and total number of students. Each row contains one observation. We still have 18 data points, but this format is optimized for statistical analysis, rather than to display for (human) visual consumption. We will refer to this restructured data as "tidy" data: it has a single column for each variable and a single row for each observation.

### Defining Tidy data

The illustrations below are lifted from an [excellent blog post](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) [@lowndesTidyDataEfficiency2020] about tidy data; they're reproduced here because

1.  they're beautiful and licensed as CCA-4.0-by, and
2.  they might be more memorable than the equivalent paragraphs of text without illustration.

Most of the time, data does not come in a format suitable for analysis. Spreadsheets are generally optimized for data entry or viewing, rather than for statistical analysis:

-   Tables may be laid out for easy data entry, so that there are multiple observations in a single row
-   It may be visually preferable to arrange columns of data to show multiple times or categories on the same row for easy comparison

When we analyze data, however, we care much more about the fundamental structure of observations: discrete units of data collection. Each observation may have several corresponding variables that may be measured simultaneously, but fundamentally each discrete data point is what we are interested in analyzing.

The structure of **tidy data** reflects this preference for keeping the data in a fundamental form: each observation is in its own row, any observed variables are in single columns. This format is inherently rectangular, which is also important for statistical analysis - our methods are typically designed to work with matrices of data.

![Tidy data format, illustrated.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_1.jpg){#fig-tidy-data-definition fig-alt="Stylized text providing an overview of Tidy Data. The top reads “Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. - Hadley Wickham.” On the left reads “In tidy data: each variable forms a column; each observation forms a row; each cell is a single measurement.” There is an example table on the lower right with columns ‘id’, ‘name’ and ‘color’ with observations for different cats, illustrating tidy data structure."}

![An illustration of the principle that every messy dataset is messy in its own way.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_2.jpg){fig-alt="There are two sets of anthropomorphized data tables. The top group of three tables are all rectangular and smiling, with a shared speech bubble reading “our columns are variables and our rows are observations!”. Text to the left of that group reads “The standard structure of tidy data means that “tidy datasets are all alike…” The lower group of four tables are all different shapes, look ragged and concerned, and have different speech bubbles reading (from left to right) “my column are values and my rows are variables”, “I have variables in columns AND in rows”, “I have multiple variables in a single column”, and “I don’t even KNOW what my deal is.” Next to the frazzled data tables is text “...but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. -Hadley Wickham.”"}

The preference for tidy data has several practical implications: it is easier to reuse code on tidy data, allowing for analysis using a standardized set of tools (rather than having to build a custom tool for each data analysis job).

![Tidy data is easier to manage because the same tools and approaches apply to multiple datasets.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_3.jpg){fig-alt="On the left is a happy cute fuzzy monster holding a rectangular data frame with a tool that fits the data frame shape. On the workbench behind the monster are other data frames of similar rectangular shape, and neatly arranged tools that also look like they would fit those data frames. The workbench looks uncluttered and tidy. The text above the tidy workbench reads “When working with tidy data, we can use the same tools in similar ways for different datasets…” On the right is a cute monster looking very frustrated, using duct tape and other tools to haphazardly tie data tables together, each in a different way. The monster is in front of a messy, cluttered workbench. The text above the frustrated monster reads “...but working with untidy data often means reinventing the wheel with one-time approaches that are hard to iterate or reuse.”"}

In addition, standardized tools for data analysis means that it is easier to collaborate with others: if everyone starts with the same set of assumptions about the dataset, you can borrow methods and tools from a collaborator's analysis and easily apply them to your own dataset.

Tidy data makes it easier to collaborate with others and analyze new data using standardized workflows.

### Examples: Messy Data {.unnumbered}

```{r tidypkgs, message = F, include = F}
library(dplyr) # Data wrangling
library(tidyr) # Data rearranging
library(tibble) # data table
```

These datasets all display the same data: TB cases documented by the WHO in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China, between 1999 and 2000. There are 4 variables: country, year, cases, and population, but each table has a different layout.

::: panel-tabset
#### Table 1 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy1, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table1, caption = "Table 1")
```

Here, each observation is a single row, each variable is a column, and everything is nicely arranged for e.g. regression or statistical analysis. We can easily compute another measure, such as cases per 100,000 population, by taking cases/population \* 100000 (this would define a new column).

#### 2 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy2, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table2, caption = "Table 2")
```

Here, we have 4 columns again, but we now have 12 rows: one of the columns is an indicator of which of two numerical observations is recorded in that row; a second column stores the value. This form of the data is more easily plotted in e.g. ggplot2, if we want to show lines for both cases and population, but computing per capita cases would be much more difficult in this form than in the arrangement in table 1.

#### 3 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy3, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table3, caption = "Table 3")
```

This form has only 3 columns, because the rate variable (which is a character) stores both the case count and the population. We can't do *anything* with this format as it stands, because we can't do math on data stored as characters. However, this form might be easier to read and record for a human being.

#### 4 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy4, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table4a, caption = "Table 4a")
knitr::kable(table4b, caption = "Table 4b")
```

In this form, we have two tables - one for population, and one for cases. Each year's observations are in a separate column. This format is often found in separate sheets of an excel workbook. To work with this data, we'll need to transform each table so that there is a column indicating which year an observation is from, and then merge the two tables together by country and year.

#### 5 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy5, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table5, caption = "Table 5")
```

Table 5 is very similar to table 3, but the year has been separated into two columns - century, and year. This is more common with year, month, and day in separate columns (or date and time in separate columns), often to deal with the fact that spreadsheets don't always handle dates the way you'd hope they would.

### Try it out: Classifying Messy Data

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

For each of the datasets in the previous example, determine whether each table is tidy. If it is not, identify which rule or rules it violates.

What would you have to do in order to compute a standardized TB infection rate per 100,000 people?

#### Table 1 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy1-2, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table1, caption = "Table 1")
```

This is tidy data. Computing a standardized infection rate is as simple as creating the variable rate = cases/population\*100,000.

#### 2 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy2-2, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table2, caption = "Table 2")
```

Each variable does not have its own column (so a single year's observation of one country actually has 2 rows). Computing a standardized infection rate requires moving cases and population so that each variable has its own column, and then you can proceed using the process in 1.

#### 3 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy3-2, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table3, caption = "Table 3")
```

Each value does not have its own cell (and each variable does not have its own column). In Table 3, you'd have to separate the numerator and denominator of each cell, convert each to a numeric variable, and then you could proceed as in 1.

#### 4 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy4-2, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table4a, caption = "Table 4a")
knitr::kable(table4b, caption = "Table 4b")
```

There are multiple observations in each row because there is not a column for year. To compute the rate, you'd need to "stack" the two columns in each table into a single column, add a year column that is 1999, 1999, 1999, 2000, 2000, 2000, and then merge the two tables. Then you could proceed as in 1.

#### 5 {.unnumbered}

```{r tidy5-2, echo = F}
knitr::kable(table5, caption = "Table 5")
```

Each variable does not have its own column (there are two columns for year, in addition to the issues noted in table3). Computing the rate would be similar to table 3; the year issues aren't actually a huge deal unless you plot them, at which point 99 will seem to be bigger than 00 (so you'd need to combine the two year columns together first).
:::
:::

It is actually impossible to have a table that violates only one of the rules of tidy data - you have to violate at least two. So a simpler way to state the rules might be:

1.  Each dataset goes into its own table (or tibble, if you are using R)
2.  Each variable gets its own column

By the end of this chapter, you will have the skills needed to wrangle the most common "messy" data sets into "tidy" form.

## String operations

Nearly always, when multiple variables are stored in a single column, they are stored as character variables. There are many different "levels" of working with strings in programming, from simple find-and-replaced of fixed (constant) strings to regular expressions, which are extremely powerful (and extremely complicated).

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. - Jamie Zawinski

: Table of string functions in R and python. `x` is the string or vector of strings, `pattern` is a pattern to be found within the string, `a` and `b` are indexes, and `encoding` is a string encoding, such as UTF8 or ASCII. {#tbl-string-function}

In @tbl-string-function, multiple functions are provided for e.g. common packages and situations. Pandas methods are specifically those which work in some sort of vectorized manner. Base methods (in R) do not require additional packages, where stringr methods require the `stringr` package, which is included in the tidyverse[^data-transformations-1].

[^data-transformations-1]: Many functions from `stringr` have somewhat faster functional equivalents in the `stringi` package, but the `stringi` package has a less "tidy" API, so it may be worth the slight slowdown to use `stringr` if your data isn't huge because your code will be more readable.

### Converting strings to numbers {.unnumbered}

One of the most common tasks when reading in and tidying messy data is that numeric-ish data can come in many forms that are read (by default) as strings. The data frame below provides an example of a few types of data which may be read in in unexpected ways. How do we tell R or Python that we want all of these columns to be treated as numbers?

```{python, echo = F}
#| label: tbl-parse-numbers
#| tbl-cap: Different "messy" number formats
#| output: asis

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'int_col': [1,2,3,4],
    'float_col': [1.1,1.2,1.3,4.7],
    'mix_col': ['a', 2, 3, 4],
    'missing_col': [1.0, 2, 3, np.nan],
    'money_col': ['£1,000.00','£2,400.00','£2,400.00','£2,400.00'],
    'eu_numbers': ['1.000.000,00', '2.000.342,00', '3.141,59', '34,25'],
    'boolean_col': [True, False, True, True],
    'custom': ['Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N']
  })

print(tabulate(df, headers = list(df.columns)))
df.to_csv("data/number-formats.csv", index = False, quoting = 1)
```

```{r, echo = F, include = F}
library(reticulate)
df <- py$df
```

Note that [numbers](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-0169/overview-8/index.html), currencies, dates, and times are written differently based on what country you're in [@ashourConciseGuideNumber2022]. In computer terms, this is the "locale", and it affects everything from how your computer formats the date/time to what character set it will try to use to display things [@LocaleComputerSoftware2022].

[If you've never had to deal with the complexities of working on a laptop designed for one country using another country's conventions, know that it isn't necessarily the easiest thing to do.]{.aside}

##### Get the data: Python {.unnumbered}

```{python, eval = F}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/main/data/number-formats.csv")

```{r, eval = F}
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/main/data/number-formats.csv", colClasses = "character")
```

By default, R tries to outsmart us and read the data in as numbers. I've disabled this behavior by setting `colClasses='character'` so that you can see how these functions work... but in general, R seems to be a bit more willing to try to guess what you want. This can be useful, but can also be frustrating when you don't know how to disable it.

##### Converting Columns Using Your Best Guess {.unnumbered}

Both R and Python have ways to "guess" what type a column is and read the data in as that type. When we initially read in the data above, I had to explicitly disable this behavior in R. If you're working with data that is already read in, how do you get R and Python to guess what type something is?

::: panel-tabset
###### R

Here, R gets everything "right" except the eu_numbers, money_col, and custom cols, which makes sense - these contain information that isn't clearly numeric or doesn't match the default numeric formatting on my machine (which is using en_US.UTF-8 for almost everything). If we additionally want R to handle `mix_col`, we would have to explicitly convert to numeric, causing the a to be converted to `NA`

```{r guess-type-conversion-r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
df_guess <- type_convert(df)
str(df_guess)
```

The `type_convert` function has a `locale` argument; `readr` includes a `locale()` function that you can pass to `type_convert` that allows you to define your own locale. Because we have numeric types structured from at least two locales in this data frame, we would have to specifically read the data in specifying which columns we wanted read with each locale.

```{r guess-type-conversion-r-locale}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
fixed_df <- type_convert(df) 
fixed_df2 <- type_convert(df, locale = locale(decimal_mark = ',', grouping_mark = '.'))
# Replace EU numbers col with the type_convert results specifying that locale
fixed_df$eu_numbers = fixed_df$eu_numbers
str(fixed_df)
```

###### Python

Similarly, Python does basically the same thing as R: mix_col, money_col, and custom are all left as strings, while floats, integers, and logical values are handled correctly.

```{python guess-type-conversion-py}
fixed_df = df.infer_objects()
fixed_df.dtypes
```

As in R, we can set the locale in Python to change how things are read in.

```{python guess-type-conversion-py-locale}
from babel.numbers import parse_decimal

# Convert eu_numbers column specifically
fixed_df['eu_numbers'] = fixed_df['eu_numbers'].apply(lambda x: parse_decimal(x, locale = 'it'))
fixed_df['eu_numbers'] = pd.to_numeric(fixed_df['eu_numbers'])
fixed_df.dtypes
```
:::

::: callout-caution
##### Converting Columns Directly {.unnumbered}

Obviously, we can also convert some strings to numbers using type conversion functions that we discussed in @sec-type-conversions. This is fairly easy in R, but a bit more complex in Python, because Python has several different types of 'missing' or NA variables that are not necessarily compatible.

::: panel-tabset
###### R

Here, we use the `across` helper function from dplyr to convert all of the columns to numeric. Note that the last 3 columns don't work here, because they contain characters R doesn't recognize as numeric characters.

```{r direct-type-conversion-r}
library(dplyr)

df_numeric <- mutate(df, across(everything(), as.numeric))
str(df_numeric)
```

###### Python

```{python direct-type-conversion-py}
df_numeric = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')
df_numeric.dtypes
```

::: callout-caution
##### Example: Converting Y/N data

The next thing we might want to do is convert our `custom` column so that it has 1 instead of Y and 0 instead of N. There are several ways we can handle this process:

-   We could use factors/categorical variables, which have numeric values "under the hood", but show up as labeled.
-   We could (in this particular case) test for equality with "Y", but this approach would not generalize well if we had more than 2 categories.
-   We could take a less nuanced approach and just find-replace and then convert to a number.

Some of these solutions are more kludgy than others, but I've used all 3 approaches when dealing with categorical data in the past, depending on what I wanted to do with it afterwards.

::: panel-tabset
###### R

```{r conversion-find-replace-r}
library(stringr) # work with strings easily
fixed_df = fixed_df %>%
  mutate(
    # factor approach
    custom1 = factor(custom, levels = c("N", "Y"), labels = c("Y", "N")),
    # test for equality
    custom2 = (custom == "Y"),
    # string replacement
    custom3 = str_replace_all(custom, c("Y" = "1", "N" = "0")) %>%
      as.numeric()
  )

str(fixed_df)
```

###### Python

We've already done a brief demonstration of string methods in Python when we trimmed off the £ character. In this situation, it's better to use the pandas `replace` method, which allows you to pass in a list of values and a list of replacements.

```{python conversion-find-replace-py}
# Categorical (factor) approach
fixed_df['custom1'] = fixed_df['custom'].astype("category") # convert to categorical variable
# Equality/boolean approach
fixed_df['custom2'] = fixed_df['custom'] == "Y"
# string replacement
fixed_df['custom3'] = fixed_df['custom'].replace(["Y", "N"], ["1", "0"]).astype("int")

fixed_df.dtypes
```
:::

### Using find and replace

Another way to fix some issues is to just find-and-replace the problematic characters. This is not always the best solution[^data-transformations-2], and may introduce bugs if you use the same code to analyze new data with characters you haven't anticipated, but in so many cases it's also the absolute easiest, fastest, simplest way forward and easily solves many different problems.

[^data-transformations-2]: It's particularly hackish when you're working with locale-specific settings [@herrmannHowDealInternational2021], and in many cases you can handle locale issues much more elegantly.

[I'll show you how to correct all of the issues reading in the data using solutions shown above, but please do consider reading @herrmannHowDealInternational2021 so that you know why find-and-replace isn't (necessarily) the best option for locale-specific formatting.]{.aside}

::: callout-caution
##### Example: find and replace

Let's start with the money column.

::: panel-tabset
###### R

In R, parse_number() handles the money column just fine - the pound sign goes away and we get a numeric value. This didn't work by default with type_convert, but as long as we `mutate` and tell R we expect a number, things work well. Then, as we did above, we can specify the locale settings so that decimal and grouping marks are handled correctly even for countries which use ',' for decimal and '.' for thousands separators.

```{r guess-type-conversion-r-money}
fixed_df = df %>%
  type_convert() %>% # guess everything
  mutate(money_col = parse_number(money_col),
         eu_numbers = parse_number(eu_numbers, 
                                   locale = locale(decimal_mark = ',', 
                                                   grouping_mark = '.')))
```

###### Python

In python, a similar approach doesn't work out, because the pound sign is not handled correctly.

```{python guess-type-conversion-py-money1, error = T}
from babel.numbers import parse_decimal

fixed_df = df.infer_objects()

# Convert eu_numbers column
fixed_df['eu_numbers'] = fixed_df['eu_numbers'].apply(lambda x: parse_decimal(x, locale = 'it'))
fixed_df['eu_numbers'] = pd.to_numeric(fixed_df['eu_numbers'])

# Convert money_col
fixed_df['money_col'] = fixed_df['money_col'].apply(lambda x: parse_decimal(x, locale = 'en_GB'))

fixed_df.dtypes
```

```{python guess-type-conversion-py-money2}
# Remove £ from string
fixed_df['money_col'] = fixed_df['money_col'].str.removeprefix("£")
# Then parse the number
fixed_df['money_col'] = fixed_df['money_col'].apply(lambda x: parse_decimal(x))
# Then convert to numeric
fixed_df['money_col'] = pd.to_numeric(fixed_df['money_col'])

fixed_df.dtypes
```

#### Example: Locale find-and-replace

We could also handle the locale issues using find-and-replace, if we wanted to...

::: panel-tabset
###### R

Note that `str_remove` is shorthand for `str_replace(x, pattern, "")`. There is a little bit of additional complexity in switching "," for "." and vice versa - we have to change "," to something else first, so that we can replace "." with ",". This is *not* elegant but it does work. It also doesn't generalize - it will mess up numbers formatted using the US/UK convention, and it won't handle numbers formatted using other conventions from other locales.

```{r find-replace-locale-r}
fixed_df = df %>%
  type_convert() %>% # guess everything
  mutate(money_col = str_remove(money_col, "£") %>% parse_number(),
         eu_numbers = str_replace_all(eu_numbers, 
                                      c("," = "_", 
                                        "\\." = ",", 
                                        "_" = ".")) %>%
           parse_number())
```

###### Python

```{python find-replace-locale-py, error = T}
from babel.numbers import parse_decimal

fixed_df = df.infer_objects()

# Convert eu_numbers column: 
# Replace . with nothing (remove .), then
# Replace , with .
fixed_df['eu_numbers'] = fixed_df['eu_numbers'].\
str.replace('\.', '').\
str.replace(',', '.')
fixed_df['eu_numbers'] = pd.to_numeric(fixed_df['eu_numbers'])

# Convert money_col
fixed_df['money_col'] = fixed_df['money_col'].\
str.removeprefix("£").\
str.replace(',', '')
fixed_df['money_col'] = pd.to_numeric(fixed_df['money_col'])

### Separating multi-variable columns

Another common situation is to have multiple variables in one column. This can happen, for instance, when conducting a factorial experiment: Instead of having separate columns for each factor, researchers sometimes combine several different factors into a single label for a condition to simplify data entry.

In pandas, we use `x.str.split()` to split columns in a DataFrame, in R we use the `tidyr` package's `separate` function.

::: callout-caution
#### Example: Separating columns

We'll use the `table3` object included in `dplyr` for this example. You can load it in R and then load the `reticuate` package to be able to access the object in python as `r.table3`.

::: panel-tabset
##### Picture the operation

![We want to separate the rate column into two new columns, cases and population.](images/data-transformations/tidyr_separate.png){fig-alt="An image showing table 3 from the messy data examples, with the rate column containing data formatted as xxx/yyy. The picture shows the transition to a similarly structured data with two new columns: cases, which contains the xxx data, and pop, which contains the yyy data."}

##### R

```{r separate-cols-r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(reticulate) # so we can access table3 in python
data(table3)
separate(table3, rate, into = c('cases', 'pop'), sep = "/", remove = F)
```

##### Python

```{python separate-cols-py}
table3 = r.table3
table3[['cases', 'pop']] = table3.rate.str.split("/", expand = True)
table3
```

This uses python's multiassign capability. Python can assign multiple things at once if those things are specified as a sequence (e.g. cases, pop). In this case, we split the rate column and assign two new columns, essentially adding two columns to our data frame and labeling them at the same time.

### Joining columns

It's also not uncommon to need to join information stored in two columns into one column. A good example of a situation in which you might need to do this is when we store first and last name separately and then need to have a 'name' column that has both pieces of information together.

::: callout-caution
#### Example: Joining columns

We'll use the `table3` object included in `dplyr` for this example. You can load it in R and then load the `reticuate` package to be able to access the object in python as `r.table3`.

::: panel-tabset
##### Picture the operation

![We want to join the century and year columns into a new column, yyyy.](images/data-transformations/tidyr_unite.png){fig-alt="An image showing table 5 from the messy data examples, with century and year columns. The picture shows the transition to a similarly structured data set with a single column, year, which contains the century and the year pasted together as a single number."}

##### R

```{r unite-cols-r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(reticulate) # so we can access table3 in python
data(table5)
unite(table5, col = yyyy, c(century, year), sep = "", remove = F) %>%
  # convert all columns to sensible types
  readr::type_convert()
```

##### Python

```{python unite-cols-py}
import pandas as pd

table5 = r.table5
# Concatenate the two columns with string addition
table5['yyyy'] = table5.century + table5.year
# convert to number
table5['yyyy'] = pd.to_numeric(table5.yyyy)
table5
```

### Regular Expressions

Matching exact strings is easy - it's just like using find and replace.

```{r regular-expressions}
human_talk <- "blah, blah, blah. Do you want to go for a walk?"
dog_hears <- str_extract(human_talk, "walk")
dog_hears
```

But, if you can master even a small amount of regular expression notation, you'll have exponentially more power to do good (or evil) when working with strings. You can get by without regular expressions if you're creative, but often they're much simpler.

#### Optional: Short Regular Expressions Primer

You may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this [web app](https://spannbaueradam.shinyapps.io/r_regex_tester/) built to test R regular expressions for R. A similar application for Perl compatible regular expressions (used by SAS and Python) can be found [here](https://regex101.com/). The subset of regular expression syntax we're going to cover here is fairly limited (and common to SAS, Python, and R, with a few adjustments), but [you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/regex?tab=Votes). As with any tool, there are situations where it's useful, and situations where you should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to.

Here are the basics of regular expressions:

-   `[]` enclose sets of characters\
    Ex: `[abc]` will match any single character `a`, `b`, `c`
    -   `-` specifies a range of characters (`A-z` matches all upper and lower case letters)
    -   to match `-` exactly, precede with a backslash (outside of `[]`) or put the `-` last (inside `[]`)
-   `.` matches any character (except a newline)
-   To match special characters, escape them using `\` (in most languages) or `\\` (in R). So `\.` or `\\.` will match a literal `.`, `\$` or `\\$` will match a literal `$`.

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

```{r phone-strings}
num_string <- "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789"

ssn <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]")
ssn
```

#### Python {.unnumbered}

In python, a regular expression is indicated by putting the character 'r' right before the quoted expression. This tells python that any backslashes in the string should be left alone -- if R had that feature, we wouldn't have to escape all the backslashes!

```{python phone-strings-py}
import re

num_string = "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789"

ssn = re.search(r"[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]", num_string)
ssn
```
:::

Listing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify repetition?

-   `*` means repeat between 0 and inf times
-   `+` means 1 or more times
-   `?` means 0 or 1 times -- most useful when you're looking for something optional
-   `{a, b}` means repeat between `a` and `b` times, where `a` and `b` are integers. `b` can be blank. So `[abc]{3,}` will match `abc`, `aaaa`, `cbbaa`, but not `ab`, `bb`, or `a`. For a single number of repeated characters, you can use `{a}`. So `{3, }` means "3 or more times" and `{3}` means "exactly 3 times"

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

```{r regular-expression-banana}
library(stringr)
str_extract("banana", "[a-z]{1,}") # match any sequence of lowercase characters
str_extract("banana", "[ab]{1,}") # Match any sequence of a and b characters
str_extract_all("banana", "(..)") # Match any two characters
str_extract("banana", "(..)\\1") # Match a repeated thing
```

```{r regular-expression-phone-ssn}

re.findall(r"(..)", "banana") # Match any two characters
re.search(r"(..)\1", "banana") # Match a repeated thing
```

```{python regular-expression-phone-ssn-py}
num_string = "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789, bank account balance: $50,000,000.23"

phone
nuid = re.search(r"[0-9]{8}", num_string)
nuid
bank_balance = re.search(r"\$[0-9,]+\.[0-9]{2}", num_string)
bank_balance
```
:::

There are also ways to "anchor" a pattern to a part of the string (e.g. the beginning or the end)

-   `^` has multiple meanings:
    -   if it's the first character in a pattern, `^` matches the beginning of a string
    -   if it follows `[`, e.g. `[^abc]`, `^` means "not" - for instance, "the collection of all characters that aren't a, b, or c".
-   `$` means the end of a string

Combined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of semi-structured string data, such as addresses.

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

```{r regular-expression-addresses}
address <- "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500"

house_num <- str_extract(address, "^[0-9]{1,}")

 # Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma
street <- str_extract(address, "[A-z0-9 ]{1,}")
street <- str_remove(street, house_num) %>% str_trim() # remove house number

city <- str_extract(address, ",.*,") %>% str_remove_all(",") %>% str_trim()

zip <- str_extract(address, "[0-9-]{5,10}$") # match 5 and 9 digit zip codes
```

#### Python {.unnumbered}

Python match objects contain 3 things: `.span()`, which has the start and end positions of the match, `.string`, which contains the original string passed into the function, and `.group()`, which contains the actual matching portion of the string.

```{python regular-expression-addresses-py}
address = "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500"

house_num = re.search(r"^[0-9]{1,}", address).group()

# Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma
street = re.search(r"[A-z0-9 ]{1,}", address).group()
street = street.replace(house_num, "").strip() # remove house number

city = re.search(",.*,", address).group().replace(",", "").strip()

zip = re.search(r"[0-9-]{5,10}$", address).group() # match 5 and 9 digit zip codes
```
:::

-   `()` are used to capture information. So `([0-9]{4})` captures any 4-digit number
-   `a|b` will select a or b.

If you've captured information using (), you can reference that information using backreferences. In most languages, those look like this: `\1` for the first reference, `\9` for the ninth. In R, backreferences are `\\1` through `\\9`.

::: panel-tabset
#### R {.unnumbered}

In R, the `\` character is special, so you have to escape it. So in R, `\\1` is the first reference, and `\\2` is the second, and so on.

## Pivot operations

It's fairly common for data to come in forms which are convenient for either human viewing or data entry. Unfortunately, these forms aren't necessarily the most friendly for analysis.

![](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/raw/main/images/static/png/original-dfs-tidy.png)

The two operations we'll learn here are wide -\> long and long -\> wide.

![](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/raw/main/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif)

This animation uses the R functions pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() [Animation source](https://github.com/kelseygonzalez/tidyexplain/tree/wider_longer), but the concept is the same in both R and python.

### Longer

In many cases, the data come in what we might call "wide" form - some of the column names are not names of variables, but instead, are themselves values of another variable.

::: panel-tabset
#### Picture the Operation

Tables 4a and 4b are good examples of data which is in "wide" form and should be in long(er) form: the years, which are variables, are column names, and the values are cases and population respectively.

```{r longer-pivot-demo}
table4a
table4b
```

The solution to this is to rearrange the data into "long form": to take the columns which contain values and "stack" them, adding a variable to indicate which column each value came from. To do this, we have to duplicate the values in any column which isn't being stacked (e.g. country, in both the example above and the image below).

![A visual representation of what the pivot_longer operation looks like in practice.](images/data-transformations/tidyr_pivot_longer.png){fig-alt="A wide-to-long transformation operation, where the values of the id variables are repeated for each column which is used as a key; the values in each column are moved into a value column. There is a row of data in the transformed data frame for each combination of id variables and key variables."}

Once our data are in long form, we can (if necessary) separate values that once served as column labels into actual variables, and we'll have tidy(er) data.

#### R

```{r tidyr-pivot-longer-demo2}
tba <- table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
tbb <- table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "year", values_to = "population")

# To get the tidy data, we join the two together (see Table joins below)
left_join(tba, tbb, by = c("country", "year")) %>%
  # make year numeric b/c it's dumb not to
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

```

The columns are moved to a variable with the name passed to the argument "names_to" (hopefully, that is easy to remember), and the values are moved to a variable with the name passed to the argument "values_to" (again, hopefully easy to remember).

We identify ID variables (variables which we don't want to pivot) by not including them in the pivot statement. We can do this in one of two ways:

-   select only variables we want to pivot: `pivot_longer(table4a, cols =`1999`:`2000`, names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")`
-   select variables we don't want to pivot, using `-` to remove them. (see above, where `-country` excludes country from the pivot operation)

Which option is easier depends how many things you're pivoting (and how the columns are structured).

If we wanted to avoid the table join, we could do this process another way: first, we would add a column to each tibble called id with values "cases" and "population" respectively. Then, we could bind the two tables together by row (so stack them on top of each other). We could then do a wide-to-long pivot, followed by a long-to-wide pivot to get our data into tidy form.

```{r tidyr-pivot-longer-id}
# Create ID columns
table4a.x <- table4a %>% mutate(id = "cases")
table4b.x <- table4b %>% mutate(id = "population")
# Create one table
table4 <- bind_rows(table4a.x, table4b.x)

table4_long <- table4 %>%
  # rearrange columns
  select(country, id, `1999`, `2000`) %>%
  # Don't pivot country or id
  pivot_longer(-c(country:id), names_to = "year", values_to = "count")

# Intermediate fully-long form
table4_long

# make wider, with case and population columns
table4_tidy <- table4_long %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = id, values_from = count)

table4_tidy
```

#### Python

In Pandas, `pandas.melt(...)` takes `id_vars`, `value_vars`, `var_name`, and `value_name`. Otherwise, it functions nearly exactly the same as `pivot_longer`; the biggest difference is that column selection works differently in python than it does in the tidyverse.

As in R, we can choose to either do a melt/pivot_longer operation on each table and then join the tables together, or we can concatenate the rows and do a melt/pivot_longer operation followed by a pivot/pivot_wider operation.

```{python pivot-longer-py2}
import pandas as pd

# Get tables from R
table4a = r.table4a
table4b = r.table4b

tba = pd.melt(table4a, id_vars = ['country'], value_vars = ['1999', '2000'], var_name = 'year', value_name = 'cases')
tbb = pd.melt(table4b, id_vars = ['country'], value_vars = ['1999', '2000'], var_name = 'year', value_name = 'population')

# To get the tidy data, we join the two together (see Table joins below)
table4_tidy = pd.merge(tba, tbb, on = ["country", "year"], how = 'left')

```

Here's the melt/pivot_longer + pivot/pivot_wider version:

```{python pivot-longer-py}
import pandas as pd

# Get tables from R
table4a = r.table4a
table4b = r.table4b

table4a['id'] = "cases"
table4b['id'] = "population"

table4 = pd.concat([table4a, table4b])

# Fully long form
table4_long = pd.melt(table4, id_vars = ['country', 'id'], value_vars = ['1999', '2000'], var_name = 'year', value_name = 'count')

# Tidy form - case and population columns
table4_tidy2 = pd.pivot(table4_long, index = ['country', 'year'], columns = ['id'], values = 'count')
# reset_index() gets rid of the grouped index
table4_tidy2.reset_index()

```
:::

### Wider

While it's very common to need to transform data into a longer format, it's not that uncommon to need to do the reverse operation. When an observation is scattered across multiple rows, your data is too long and needs to be made wider again.

::: panel-tabset
#### Picture the Operation

Table 2 is an example of a table that is in long format but needs to be converted to a wider layout to be "tidy" - there are separate rows for cases and population, which means that a single observation (one year, one country) has two rows.

![A visual representation of what the pivot_wider operation looks like in practice.](images/data-transformations/tidyr_pivot_wider.png){fig-alt="An illustration of the transition from long data to wide data. In the long data frame, there are alternating rows of cases and populations, with corresponding counts. In the wide data frame, for each combination of id variables country and year, there are two columns: cases, and pop, each with corresponding values. That is, the key variables (cases, pop) in the long data frame become columns in the wide data frame."}

#### R

```{r pivot-wider-demo}
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

#### Python

```{python pivot-wider-py}
table2 = r.table2

pd.pivot(table2, index = ['country', 'year'], columns = ['type'], values = 'count').reset_index()
```

### Try it Out!

In the next section, we'll be using the WHO surveillance of disease incidence data ([link](https://immunizationdata.who.int/)). I originally wrote this using data from 2020, but the WHO has since migrated to a new system and now provides their data in a much tidier long form ([Excel link](http://www.who.int/entity/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/incidence_series.xls)). For demonstration purposes, I'll continue using the messier 2020 data, but the link is no longer available on the WHO's site.

It will require some preprocessing before it's suitable for a demonstration. I'll do some of it, but in this section, you're going to do the rest.

::: panel-tabset
#### Preprocessing

You don't have to understand what this code is doing just yet.

```{r tryitout-who-surveillance}
library(readxl)
library(purrr) # This uses the map() function as a replacement for for loops. 
# It's pretty sweet

sheets <- excel_sheets("data/incidence_series.xls")
sheets <- sheets[-c(1, length(sheets))] # get rid of 1st and last sheet name

# This command says "for each sheet, read in the excel file with that sheet name"
# map_df means paste them all together into a single data frame
disease_incidence <- map_df(sheets, ~read_xls(path ="data/incidence_series.xls", sheet = .))

# Alternately, we could write a loop:
disease_incidence2 <- tibble() # Blank data frame
for (i in 1:length(sheets)) {
  disease_incidence2 <- bind_rows(
    disease_incidence2, 
    read_xls(path = "data/incidence_series.xls", sheet = sheets[i])
  )
}

# export for Python (and R, if you want)
readr::write_csv(disease_incidence, file = "data/who_disease_incidence.csv")
```

#### Problem

Download the exported data [here](data/who_disease_incidence.csv) and import it into Python and R. Transform it into long format, so that there is a year column. You should end up with a table that has dimensions of approximately 6 columns and 83,000 rows (or something close to that).

Can you make a line plot of cases of measles in Bangladesh over time?

```{r print-data}
head(disease_incidence)
```

#### R solution

```{r tryitout-surveillance-cleaning}
who_disease <- read_csv("data/who_disease_incidence.csv", na = ".")

who_disease_long <- who_disease %>%
  pivot_longer(matches("\\d{4}"), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases") %>%
  rename(Country = Cname) %>%
  mutate(Disease = str_replace(Disease, "CRS", "Congenital Rubella"),
         year = as.numeric(year))

filter(who_disease_long, Country == "Bangladesh", Disease == "measles") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases)) + geom_line()
```

#### Python solution

```{python tryitout-surveillance-cleaning-py}
import pandas as pd
from plotnine import *

who_disease = pd.read_csv("data/who_disease_incidence.csv", na_values = ['NA', 'NaN'])
who_disease_long = pd.melt(who_disease, id_vars = ['WHO_REGION', 'ISO_code', 'Cname', 'Disease'], var_name = 'year', value_name = 'cases')
# Rename cname to country
who_disease_long = who_disease_long.rename(columns={"Cname": "Country"})
who_disease_long.replace("CRS", "Congenital Rubella")
who_disease_long['year'] = pd.to_numeric(who_disease_long['year'])

tmp = who_disease_long.query("Country=='Bangladesh' & Disease == 'measles'")
ggplot(tmp, aes(x = "year", y = "cases")) + geom_line()

## Merging Tables

The final essential data tidying and transformation skill you need to acquire is joining tables. It is common for data to be organized **relationally** - that is, certain aspects of the data apply to a group of data points, and certain aspects apply to individual data points, and there are relationships between the individual data points and the groups of data points that have to be documented.

::: callout-caution
### Relational Data Example: Primary School Records

Each individual has certain characteristics:

-   full_name
-   gender
-   birth date
-   ID number

Each student has specific characteristics:

-   ID number
-   parent name
-   parent phone number
-   medical information
-   Class ID

Teachers may also have additional information:

-   ID number
-   Class ID
-   employment start date
-   education level
-   compensation level

There are also fields like grades, which occur for each student in each class, but multiple times a year.

-   ID number
-   Student ID
-   Class ID
-   year
-   term number
-   subject
-   grade
-   comment

And for teachers, there are employment records on a yearly basis

-   ID number
-   Employee ID
-   year
-   rating
-   comment

But each class also has characteristics that describe the whole class as a unit:

-   location ID
-   class ID
-   meeting time
-   grade level

Each location might also have some logistical information attached:

-   location ID
-   room number
-   building
-   number of seats
-   AV equipment

![Primary School Database Schema](images/data-transformations/PrimarySchoolExample.png) <!-- <a href="https://dbdiagram.io/embed/5ef387179ea313663b3b048e">Link to diagram of the database</a> -->

We could go on, but you can see that this data is hierarchical, but also relational: - each class has both a teacher and a set of students - each class is held in a specific location that has certain equipment

It would be silly to store this information in a single table (though it probably can be done) because all of the teacher information would be duplicated for each student in each class; all of the student's individual info would be duplicated for each grade. There would be a lot of wasted storage space and the tables would be much more confusing as well.

But, relational data also means we have to put in some work when we have a question that requires information from multiple tables. Suppose we want a list of all of the birthdays in a certain class. We would need to take the following steps:

-   get the Class ID
-   get any teachers that are assigned that Class ID - specifically, get their ID number
-   get any students that are assigned that Class ID - specifically, get their ID number
-   append the results from teachers and students so that there is a list of all individuals in the class
-   look through the "individual data" table to find any individuals with matching ID numbers, and keep those individuals' birth days.

It is helpful to develop the ability to lay out a set of tables in a schema (because often, database schemas aren't well documented) and mentally map out the steps that you need to combine tables to get the information you want from the information you have.
:::

Table joins allow us to combine information stored in different tables, keeping certain information (the stuff we need) while discarding extraneous information.

**keys** are values that are found in multiple tables that can be used to connect the tables. A key (or set of keys) uniquely identify an observation. A **primary key** identifies an observation in its own table. A **foreign key** identifies an observation in another table.

There are 3 main types of table joins:

-   Mutating joins, which add columns from one table to matching rows in another table\
    Ex: adding birthday to the table of all individuals in a class

-   Filtering joins, which remove rows from a table based on whether or not there is a matching row in another table (but the columns in the original table don't change)\
    Ex: finding all teachers or students who have class ClassID

-   Set operations, which treat observations as set elements (e.g. union, intersection, etc.)\
    Ex: taking the union of all student and teacher IDs to get a list of individual IDs

### Animating Joins

Note: all of these animations are stolen from https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain.

If we start with two tables, x and y,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/static/png/original-dfs.png)

#### Mutating Joins

We're primarily going to focus on mutating joins, as filtering joins can be accomplished by ... filtering ... rather than by table joins.

::: panel-tabset
##### Inner Join

We can do a filtering `inner_join` to keep only rows which are in both tables (but we keep all columns)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/inner-join.gif)

##### Left Join

But what if we want to keep all of the rows in x? We would do a `left_join`

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/left-join.gif)

If there are multiple matches in the y table, though, we might have to duplicate rows in x. This is still a left join, just a more complicated one.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/left-join-extra.gif)

##### Right Join

If we wanted to keep all of the rows in y, we would do a `right_join`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/right-join.gif)

(or, we could do a left join with y and x, but... either way is fine).

##### Full Join

And finally, if we want to keep all of the rows, we'd do a `full_join`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/full-join.gif)

You can find other animations corresponding to filtering joins and set operations [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/master/images/full-join.gif)
:::

Every join has a "left side" and a "right side" - so in `some_join(A, B)`, A is the left side, B is the right side.

Joins are differentiated based on how they treat the rows and columns of each side. In mutating joins, the columns from both sides are always kept.

+-------+-----------+------------+----------+
|       | Left Side | Right Side |          |
+-------+-----------+------------+----------+
|       | Join Type | Rows       | Cols     |
+-------+-----------+------------+----------+
| inner | matching  | all        | matching |
+-------+-----------+------------+----------+
| left  | all       | all        | matching |
+-------+-----------+------------+----------+
| right | matching  | all        | all      |
+-------+-----------+------------+----------+
| outer | all       | all        | all      |
+-------+-----------+------------+----------+

##### Demonstration: Mutating Joins

::: panel-tabset
###### R

```{r mutating-joins1-r}
t1 <- tibble(x = c("A", "B", "D"), y = c(1, 2, 3))
t2 <- tibble(x = c("B", "C", "D"), z = c(2, 4, 5))
```

An inner join keeps only rows that exist on both sides, but keeps all columns.

```{r mutating-joins2-r}
inner_join(t1, t2)
```

A left join keeps all of the rows in the left side, and adds any columns from the right side that match rows on the left. Rows on the left that don't match get filled in with NAs.

```{r mutating-joins3-r}
left_join(t1, t2)
left_join(t2, t1)
```

There is a similar construct called a right join that is equivalent to flipping the arguments in a left join. The row and column ordering may be different, but all of the same values will be there

```{r mutating-joins4-r}
right_join(t1, t2)
right_join(t2, t1)
```

An outer join keeps everything - all rows, all columns. In dplyr, it's known as a `full_join`.

```{r mutating-joins5-r}
full_join(t1, t2)
```

###### Python

```{python mutating-joins1-py}
# This works because I already created the objects in R
# and have the reticulate package loaded
t1 = r.t1
t2 = r.t2
```

An inner join keeps only rows that exist on both sides, but keeps all columns.

```{python mutating-joins2-py}
import pandas as pd
pd.merge(t1, t2, on = ['x']) # inner is default
```

A left join keeps all of the rows in the left side, and adds any columns from the right side that match rows on the left. Rows on the left that don't match get filled in with NAs.

```{python mutating-joins3-py}
pd.merge(t1, t2, on  = 'x', how = 'left')
pd.merge(t2, t1, on = 'x', how = 'left')
```

There is a similar construct called a right join that is equivalent to flipping the arguments in a left join. The row and column ordering may be different, but all of the same values will be there

```{python mutating-joins4-py}
pd.merge(t1, t2, on  = 'x', how = 'right')
pd.merge(t2, t1, on = 'x', how = 'right')
```

An outer join keeps everything - all rows, all columns.

```{python mutating-joins5-py}
pd.merge(t1, t2, on  = 'x', how = 'outer')
```

I've included the other types of joins as animations because the animations are so useful for understanding the concept, but feel free to read through more information on these types of joins [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#filtering-joins) [@r4ds].

#### Filtering Joins

::: panel-tabset
##### Semi Join

A semi join keeps matching rows from x and y, discarding all other rows and keeping only the columns from x.

![](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/raw/main/images/semi-join.gif)

##### Anti Join

An anti-join keeps rows in x that do not have a match in y, and only keeps columns in x.

#### Set Operations

::: panel-tabset
##### Union

All unique rows from x and y

Or, all unique rows from y and x.

![](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/raw/main/images/union-rev.gif)

##### Union All

All rows from x and y, keeping duplicate rows.

##### Intersection

Common rows in x and y, keeping only unique rows.

### Example: NYC Flights

We'll use the `nycflights13` package in R. Unfortunately, the data in this package are too big for me to reasonably store on github (you'll recall, I had to use a small sample the last time we played with this data...). So before we can work with this data, we have to load the tables into Python.

::: panel-tabset
#### Loading Data: R

```{r dataset-setup-demo}
if (!"nycflights13" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("nycflights13")
if (!"dbplyr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("dbplyr")
library(nycflights13)
library(dbplyr)
library(reticulate)
# This saves the database to a sqlite db file.
# You will want to specify your own path
nycflights13_sqlite(path = "data/")
```

#### Python

```{python, eval = F}
import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect("data/nycflights13.sqlite")
cur = con.cursor()
```

#### Mutating Joins

These functions may become a bit more interesting once we try them out on real-world data. Using the flights data, let's determine whether there's a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays.

::: panel-tabset
##### R

```{r flights-delay-age-R}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6
#| out-width: "45%"
#| fig-show: 'hold'
#| layout-ncol: 2
library(nycflights13)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

plane_age <- planes %>%
  mutate(age = 2013 - year) %>% # This gets us away from having to deal with 2 different year columns
  select(tailnum, age, manufacturer)

delays_by_plane <- flights %>%
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay, carrier, flight, tailnum)

# We only need to keep delays that have a plane age, so use inner join
res <- inner_join(delays_by_plane, plane_age, by = "tailnum")

ggplot(res, aes(x = age, y = dep_delay, group = cut_width(age, 1, center = 0))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylab("Departure Delay (min)") + 
  xlab("Plane age") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-20, 50))

ggplot(res, aes(x = age, y = arr_delay, group = cut_width(age, 1, center = 0))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylab("Arrival Delay (min)") + 
  xlab("Plane age") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-30, 60))
```

It doesn't look like there's much of a relationship to me. If anything, older planes are more likely to be early, but I suspect there aren't enough of them to make that conclusion (`r sprintf("%.2f%%", mean(plane_age$age > 25, na.rm = T) * 100)` are over 25 years old, and `r sprintf("%.2f%%", mean(plane_age$age > 40, na.rm = T) * 100)` are over 40 years old).

##### Python

```{python flights-delay-age-py}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6
#| out-width: "45%"
#| fig-show: 'hold'
#| layout-ncol: 2
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
from plotnine import *
con = sqlite3.connect("data/nycflights13.sqlite")

planes = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM planes", con)
flights = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM flights", con)

con.close() # close connection

plane_age = planes.assign(age = lambda df: 2013 - df.year).loc[:,["tailnum", "age", "manufacturer"]]

delays_by_plane = flights.loc[:, ["dep_delay", "arr_delay", "carrier", "flight", "tailnum"]]

res = pd.merge(plane_age, delays_by_plane, on = "tailnum", how = "inner")

# cut_width isn't in plotnine, so we have to create the bins ourselves first
age_bins = [i for i in range(2 + int(max(res.age)))] 
res = res.assign(agebin = pd.cut(res.age, age_bins))
# res.agebin.value_counts(dropna=False)

(
ggplot(res, aes(x = "age", y = "dep_delay", group = "agebin")) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylab("Departure Delay (min)") + 
  xlab("Plane age") + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = [-20, 50])
)

  geom_boxplot() + 
  ylab("Arrival Delay (min)") +

## Example: Gas Prices Data

The US Energy Information Administration tracks gasoline prices, with data available on a weekly level since late 1994. You can go to [this site](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0u_pte_nus_dpg&f=w) to see a nice graph of gas prices, along with a corresponding table. <!-- (or you can look at the screenshot below, as I don't really trust that the site design will stay the same...) -->

![Gas prices at US EIA site](images/data-transformations/06_gas_prices_screenshot.png)

The data in the table is structured in a fairly easy to read form: each row is a month; each week in the month is a set of two columns: one for the date, one for the average gas price. While this data is definitely not tidy, it is readable.

But looking at the chart at the top of the page, it's not clear how we might get that chart from the data in the format it's presented here: to get a chart like that, we would need a table where each row was a single date, and there were columns for date and price. That would be tidy form data, and so we have to get from the wide, human-readable form into the long, tidier form that we can graph.

::: callout-tip
### Try it out: Manual Formatting in Excel

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

An excel spreadsheet of the data as downloaded in July 2022 is available [here](data/gas_prices.xlsx). Can you manually format the data (or even just the first year or two of data) into a long, skinny format?

What steps are involved?

#### Solution

1.  Copy the year-month column, creating one vertical copy for every set of columns

2.  Move each block of two columns down to the corresponding vertical copy

3.  Delete empty rows

4.  Format dates

5.  Delete empty columns

### Setup: Gas Price Data Cleaning

For the next two examples, we'll read the data in from the HTML table online and work to make it something we could e.g. plot. Before we can start cleaning, we have to read in the data:

```{r web-gas-data-reading}
library(rvest) # scrape data from the web
library(xml2) # parse xml data
url <- "https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0u_pte_nus_dpg&f=w"

htmldoc <- read_html(url)
gas_prices_html <- html_table(htmldoc, fill = T, trim = T)[[5]]
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(gas_prices_html), caption = "First 6 rows of gas prices data as read into R")
```

```{python web-gas-data-reading-py}
import pandas as pd
gas_prices_html = pd.read_html("https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0u_pte_nus_dpg&f=w")[4]
```

```{python}
#| results: "asis"
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
print(tabulate(gas_prices_html.head(), headers = list(gas_prices_html.columns)))
```

### Try it out: Formatting with Pivot Operations

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

Can you format the data in a long-skinny format for plotting using pivot operations without any database merges?

Write out a list of steps, and for each step, sketch out what the data frame should look like.

How do your steps compare to the steps you used for the manual approach?

#### Sketch

![Steps to work through the gas prices data cleaning process](images/data-transformations/gas-prices-steps.png){fig-alt="Step 1: set row names to be more descriptive and remove header row. Step 2: Remove empty columns and pivot to long form, with dates and values in the same column and a description column that indicates what type of data is in the value column. Step 3: separate the week and variable information into different columns, discarding the week label. Step 4: pivot wider, so that date and value information are each in a single column. Step 5: remove rows with no values and create a yyyy-mm-dd format date. Step 6: Convert date and value into appropriate types (date, numeric)."}

#### R solution

```{r tidyverse-gas-data}

# Function to clean up column names
# Written as an extra function because it makes the code a lot cleaner

  # Add extra header row information
  paste(x, c("", rep(c("Date", "Value"), times = 5))) %>%
    # trim leading/trailing spaces
    str_trim() %>%
    # replace characters in names that aren't ok for variables in R
    make.names()
}

# Clean up the table a bit
gas_prices_raw <- gas_prices_html %>%
  set_names(fix_gas_names(names(.))) %>%
  # remove first row that is really an extra header row
  filter(Year.Month != "Year-Month") %>%
  # get rid of empty rows
  filter(Year.Month != "")

### Try it out: Formatting using merge + pivot

::: panel-tabset
#### Problem

Can you format the data in a long-skinny format for plotting using pivot operations using wide-to-long pivot operation(s) and a database merge?

You can start with the `gas_prices_raw`

Write out a list of steps, and for each step, sketch out what the data frame should look like.

How do your steps compare to the steps you used for the manual approach?

#### Sketch

![](images/data-transformations/gas-prices-steps2.png) \#### R solution

We'll use the same data cleaning function as before:

```{r gas-data-pivot-merge-r}
# Clean up the table a bit
gas_prices_raw <- gas_prices_html %>%
  set_names(fix_gas_names(names(.))) %>%
  # remove first row that is really an extra header row
  filter(Year.Month != "Year-Month") %>%
  # get rid of empty rows
  filter(Year.Month != "")

head(gas_prices_raw)
```

```{r gas-data-pivot-merge-2-r}
gas_prices_dates <- select(gas_prices_raw, 1, matches("Week.[1-5].Date"))
gas_prices_values <- select(gas_prices_raw, 1, matches("Week.[1-5].Value"))

head(gas_prices_dates)
head(gas_prices_values)
```

```{r gas-data-pivot-merge-3-r}
gas_prices_dates_long <- pivot_longer(gas_prices_dates, -Year.Month, names_to = "week", values_to = "month_day")
gas_prices_values_long <- pivot_longer(gas_prices_values, -Year.Month, names_to = "week", values_to = "price_per_gallon")

head(gas_prices_dates_long)
head(gas_prices_values_long)
```

```{r gas-data-pivot-merge-4-r}
library(lubridate) # ymd function
gas_prices_dates_long_clean <- gas_prices_dates_long %>%
  filter(month_day != "") %>%
  mutate(week = str_extract(week, "\\d") %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  mutate(year = str_extract(Year.Month, "\\d{4}"), 
         Date = paste(year, month_day, sep = "/") %>% 
           ymd())

gas_prices_values_long_clean <- gas_prices_values_long %>%
  filter(price_per_gallon != "") %>%
  mutate(week = str_extract(week, "\\d") %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  mutate(price_per_gallon = as.numeric(price_per_gallon))

head(gas_prices_dates_long_clean)
head(gas_prices_values_long_clean)
```

```{r gas-data-pivot-merge-5-r}
gas_prices <- left_join(gas_prices_dates_long_clean, gas_prices_values_long_clean, by = c("Year.Month", "week")) %>%
  select(Date, price_per_gallon)
head(gas_prices)
```

#### Python solution

```{python gas-data-pivot-merge-1-py}
gas_prices_raw = gas_prices_html

# What do column names look like?
gas_prices_raw.columns # Multi-Index 
# (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25189575/pandas-dataframe-select-columns-in-multiindex)

colnames = fix_gas_names(gas_prices_raw.columns.get_level_values(0))
colnames

# Set new column names
gas_prices_raw.columns = colnames

# Drop any rows with NaN in Year-Month
gas_prices_raw = gas_prices_raw.dropna(axis = 0, subset = ['Year-Month'])

gas_prices_raw.head()
```

```{python gas-data-pivot-merge-2-py}
gas_prices_dates = gas_prices_raw.filter(regex = 'Year-Month|Week.\d.Date', axis = 1)
gas_prices_values = gas_prices_raw.filter(regex = 'Year-Month|Week.\d.Value', axis = 1)

gas_prices_dates.head()
gas_prices_values.head()
```

```{python gas-data-pivot-merge-3-py}
gas_prices_dates_long = pd.melt(gas_prices_dates, id_vars = 'Year-Month', var_name = "week", value_name = "month_day")
gas_prices_values_long = pd.melt(gas_prices_values, id_vars = 'Year-Month', var_name = "week", value_name = "price_per_gallon")

gas_prices_dates_long.head()
gas_prices_values_long.head()
```

```{python gas-data-pivot-merge-4-py}
gas_prices_dates_long_clean = gas_prices_dates_long.dropna(subset = "month_day")
gas_prices_dates_long_clean["week"] = gas_prices_dates_long_clean.week.str.extract(r"Week.(\d).Date")
gas_prices_dates_long_clean["year"] = gas_prices_dates_long_clean["Year-Month"].str.extract(r"(\d{4})-[A-z]{3}")
gas_prices_dates_long_clean["Date"] = gas_prices_dates_long_clean.year + "/" + gas_prices_dates_long_clean.month_day
gas_prices_dates_long_clean["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(gas_prices_dates_long_clean.Date)


gas_prices_values_long_clean = gas_prices_values_long.dropna(subset = "price_per_gallon")
gas_prices_values_long_clean["week"] = gas_prices_values_long_clean.week.str.extract(r"Week.(\d).Value")
gas_prices_values_long_clean["price_per_gallon"] = pd.to_numeric(gas_prices_values_long_clean["price_per_gallon"])

gas_prices_dates_long_clean.head()
gas_prices_values_long_clean.head()
```

```{python gas-data-pivot-merge-5-py}
gas_prices = pd.merge(gas_prices_dates_long_clean, gas_prices_values_long_clean, on = ("Year-Month", "week")).loc[:,["Date", "price_per_gallon"]]
gas_prices.head()
```
