But, this is also the chapter where we really start to focus on R.

A visual display can stop your mental flow in its tracks and make you think. A visual display can force you to notice what you never expected to see. (\"Why, that scatter diagram has a hole in the middle!\") -- @tukeyDataBasedGraphicsVisual1990\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n### Charts are easier to understand than raw data. \n\nWhen you think about it, data is a pretty artificial thing. We exist in a world of tangible objects, but data are an abstraction - even when the data record information about the tangible world, the measurements are a way of removing the physical and transforming the \"real world\" into a virtual thing. As a result, it can be hard to wrap our heads around what our data contain. The solution to this is to transform our data back into something that is \"tangible\" in some way -- if not physical and literally touch-able, at least something we can view and \"wrap our heads around\". \n\nConsider this thought experiment: You have a simple data set - 2 variables, 500 observations. You want to get a sense of how the variables relate to each other. You can do one of the following options:\n\n1. Print out the data set\n2. Create some summary statistics of each variable and perhaps the covariance between the two variables\n3. Draw a scatter plot of the two variables\n\nWhich one would you rather use? Why?\n\nOur brains are very good at processing large amounts of visual information quickly. Evolutionarily, it's important to be able to e.g. survey a field and pick out the tiger that might eat you. When we present information visually, in a format that can leverage our visual processing abilities, we offload some of the work of understanding the data to a chart that organizes it for us. You could argue that printing out the data is a visual presentation, but it requires that you read that data in as text, which we're not nearly as equipped to process quickly (and in parallel). \n:::\n\nIt's a lot easier to talk to non-experts about complicated statistics using visualizations. Moving the discussion from abstract concepts to concrete shapes and lines keeps people who are potentially already math or stat phobic from completely tuning out.\n\n## General approaches to creating graphics\n\nThere are two general approaches to generating statistical graphics computationally: \n  \n1. Manually specify the plot that you want, doing the preprocessing and summarizing before you create the plot.\n\n2. Describe the relationship between the plot and the data, using sensible defaults that can be customized for common operations.\n\nIn the introduction to The Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics1999], Leland Wilkinson suggests that the first approach is what we would call \"charts\" - pie charts, line charts, bar charts - objects that are \"instances of much more general objects\". His argument is that elegant graphical design means we have to think about an underlying theory of graphics, rather than how to create specific charts. The 2nd approach is called the \"grammar of graphics\". \n\nBase R graphics, matplotlib graphics in Python, and the original SAS graphics engine fall firmly into the first camp. `ggplot2` was designed using the philosophy of the grammar of graphics, and is still the primary place that people learn about the grammar of graphics in statistics.\n\n::: callout-note\nYou're going to learn how to make graphics by finding sample code, changing that code to match your data set, and tweaking things as you go. That's the best way to learn this, and while option 2 does have a structure and some syntax to learn, once you're familiar with the principles, you'll still want to learn graphics by doing it. \n:::\n\nThere are other graphics systems in R (namely, `lattice`, plus some web-based rendering engines) that you could explore, but it's far more important that you know how to functionally create plots in R and/or Python. I don't recommend you try to become proficient in all of them. Pick one (two at most) and get to know that, then google for the rest.\n\nBefore we delve into the grammar of graphics, let's motivate the philosophy using a simple task. Suppose we want to create a pie chart using some data. Pie charts are terrible, and we've known it for 100 years[@croxtonBarChartsCircle1927a], so in the interests of showing that we know that pie charts are awful, we'll also create a stacked bar chart, which is the most commonly promoted alternative to a pie chart. We'll talk about what makes pie charts terrible at the end of this module. \n\n::: callout-caution\n### Example: Generations of Pokemon\n\nSuppose we want to explore Pokemon. There's not just the original 150 (gotta catch 'em all!) - now there are over 1000! \nLet's start out by looking at the proportion of Pokemon added in each of the 8 generations.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R setup {-}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Setup the data\npoke <- read_csv(\"data/pokemon_ascii.csv\", na = '.') %>%\n  mutate(generation = factor(generation))\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Python setup {-}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\npoke = pd.read_csv(\"data/pokemon_ascii.csv\")\npoke['generation'] = pd.Categorical(poke.generation)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nOnce the data is read in, we can start plotting:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### Base R {-}\n\nLet's start with what we want: for each generation, we want the total number of pokemon. \n\nTo get a pie chart, we want that information mapped to a circle, with each generation represented by an angle whose size is proportional to the number of pokemon in that generation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create summary of pokemon by type\ntmp <- poke %>%\n  group_by(generation) %>%\n  count() \n\npie(tmp$n, labels = tmp$generation)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data-vis_files/figure-html/base-pie-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\n# with(., <base command>) let you use the pipe easily with a base R command\n# that is otherwise not pipe friendly, e.g. \n# with(tmp, pie(n, labels = generation))\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe could alternately make a bar chart and stack the bars on top of each other. This also shows proportion (section vs. total) but does so in a linear fashion.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create summary of pokemon by type\ntmp <- poke %>%\n  group_by(generation) %>%\n  count() \n\n# Matrix is necessary for a stacked bar chart\nmatrix(tmp$n, nrow = 8, ncol = 1, dimnames = list(tmp$generation)) %>%\nbarplot(beside = F, legend.text = T, main = \"Generations of Pokemon\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data-vis_files/figure-html/base-barplot-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### ggplot2 {-}\nIn ggplot2, we start by specifying which variables we want to be mapped to which features of the data. \n\nIn a pie or stacked bar chart, we don't care about the x coordinate - the whole chart is centered at (0,0) or is contained in a single \"stack\". So it's easiest to specify our x variable as a constant, \"\". We care about the fill of the slices, though - we want each generation to have a different fill color, so we specify generation as our fill variable. \n\nThen, we want to summarize our data by the number of objects in each category - this is basically a stacked bar chart. Any variables specified in the plot statement are used to implicitly calculate the statistical summary we want -- that is, to count the rows (so if we had multiple x variables, the summary would be computed for both the x and fill variables). ggplot is smart enough to know that when we use `geom_bar`, we generally want the y variable to be the count, so we can get away with leaving that part out. We just have to specify that we want the bars to be stacked on top of one another (instead of next to each other, \"dodge\").\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(aes(x = \"\", fill = generation), data = poke) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data-vis_files/figure-html/gg-bar-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we want a pie chart, we can get one very easily - we transform the coordinate plane from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. We specify that we want angle to correspond to the \"y\" coordinate, and that we want to start at $\\theta = 0$. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(aes(x = \"\", fill = generation), data = poke) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"stack\") + \n  coord_polar(\"y\", start = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data-vis_files/figure-html/gg-pie-1.png){width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice how the syntax and arguments to the functions didn't change much between the bar chart and the pie chart? That's because the `ggplot` package uses what's called the **grammar of graphics**, which is a way to describe plots based on the underlying mathematical relationships between data and plotted objects. In base R and in matplotlib in Python, different types of plots will have different syntax, arguments, etc., but in ggplot2, the arguments are consistently named, and for plots which require similar transformations and summary observations, it's very easy to switch between plot types by changing one word or adding one transformation.\n\n#### Matplotlib {-}\n\nLet's start with what we want: for each generation, we want the total number of pokemon. \n\nTo get a pie chart, we want that information mapped to a circle, with each generation represented by an angle whose size is proportional to the number of Pokemon in that generation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.cla() # clear out matplotlib buffer\n\n# Create summary of pokemon by type\nlabels = list(set(poke.generation)) # create labels by getting unique values\nsizes = poke.generation.value_counts(normalize=True)*100\n\n# Draw the plot\nfig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()\nax1.pie(sizes, labels = labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle = 90)\n## ([<matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd47db580>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd47e8af0>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd47fa220>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd47fa940>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd47880a0>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd47887c0>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd4788ee0>, <matplotlib.patches.Wedge object at 0x7fddd4796640>], [Text(-0.6090293244431805, 0.916014891783034, '1'), Text(-1.091376662290067, -0.1374662904445805, '2'), Text(-0.447205636991834, -1.004991103563971, '3'), Text(0.4837518599092984, -0.9879190948829235, '4'), Text(1.004991103563971, -0.44720563699183413, '5'), Text(1.0756351166663767, 0.23023704261936323, '6'), Text(0.780190906881347, 0.7754367471429643, '7'), Text(0.2825357301945357, 1.06309621444319, '8')], [Text(-0.33219781333264387, 0.4996444864271094, '18.7%'), Text(-0.5952963612491273, -0.07498161296977117, '16.6%'), Text(-0.24393034745009126, -0.5481769655803478, '16.1%'), Text(0.2638646508596173, -0.538864960845231, '11.8%'), Text(0.5481769655803477, -0.2439303474500913, '10.4%'), Text(0.5867100636362054, 0.12558384142874357, '9.6%'), Text(0.42555867648073464, 0.42296549844161685, '8.6%'), Text(0.15411039828792855, 0.5798706624235581, '8.3%')])\nax1.axis('equal')\n## (-1.1150076843840162, 1.1060059449729593, -1.1113209244032165, 1.1005390916382485)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data-vis_files/figure-html/plt-pie-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe could alternately make a bar chart and stack the bars on top of each other.

For each concept, I'll provide you first with the ggplot grammar of graphics code, and then, where it is possible to replicate the chart easily in base R or Python graphics, I will provide code for that as well - so that you can compare the approaches, but also so that you get a sense for what is easy and what is possible in each plotting system. \n\n\n## The Grammar of Graphics\n\n<!-- A basic sentence has a subject and a predicate (usually, this contains a verb), but of course, there are infinintely many ways to combine and expand on a single sentence. The structure of the sentence describes how the subject relates to the predicate, with clauses and so on that modify the original meaning.  -->\n\n<!-- The grammar of graphics is designed as an object-oriented graphics system. That is, the idea is that there are certain objects that communicate with each other. Each object does a few things well, and the intelligence is in the system, not in the objects themselves. This design principle means that objects can be repurposed for many things (because each object is relatively simple and modular).  -->\n\nIn the grammar of graphics, a plot consists of several mostly independent specifications:\n\n1. **aesthetics** - links between data variables and graphical features (position, color, shape, size)\n2. **layers** - geometric elements (points, lines, rectangles, text, ...) \n3. **transformations** - transformations specify a functional link between the data and the displayed information (identity, count, bins, density, regression). Transformations act on the variables. \n4. **scales** - scales map values in data space to values in the aesthetic space. Scales change the coordinate space of an aesthetic, but don't change the underlying value (so the change is at the visual level, not the mathematical level). \n5. **coordinate system** - e.g. polar or Cartesian\n6. **faceting** - facets allow you to split plots by other variables to produce many sub-plots.\n7. **theme** - formatting items, such as background color, fonts, margins...\n\nWe can contrast this with other plotting systems (e.g. Base R, matplotlib, seaborn), where transformations and scales must be handled manually, there may be separate plotting systems for different coordinate systems, etc. \n\nFunctionally, the biggest difference between the two systems is that in the grammar of graphics system (as implemented in ggplot2), we work with a full tabular data set. So like the rest of the tidyverse, ggplot2 will allow you to reference bare column names as if they were variables, so long as you've passed in the data set to the `data =` argument.\n\n::: aside\nThis can sometimes be a pain, because you may end up with labels that are repeated many, many times. As with any system, you just have to make sure you're formatting your data in a way that is consistent and compatible with the underlying philosophy.\n:::\n\n![Building a masterpiece, by Allison Horst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/ggplot2_masterpiece.png){fig-alt=\"A fuzzy monster in a beret and scarf, critiquing their own column graph on a canvas in front of them while other assistant monsters (also in berets) carry over boxes full of elements that can be used to customize a graph (like themes and geometric shapes).
