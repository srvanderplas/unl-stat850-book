To do this, you should be master the following concepts:\n\n-   Determine what data format is necessary to generate a desired plot or statistical model\n-   Join and split data columns using string operations\n-   Understand the differences between \"wide\" and \"long\" format data and how to transition between the two structures\n-   Understand relational data formats and how to use data joins to assemble data from multiple tables into a single table.\n\n> Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. - Leo Tolstoy\n\n> Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. - Hadley Wickham\n\n## Tidy and Messy Data\n\n### Motivating Example\n\nConsider the spreadsheet screenshot in @fig-human-readable.\n\n![Spreadsheet intended for human consumption, from @mccallumBadDataHandbook2013 (Chapter 3)](images/data-transformations/Data-human-consumption.png){#fig-human-readable}\n\nThis spreadsheet shows New Zealand High School certificate achievement levels for a boys-only school. Typically, students would get level 1 in year 11, level 2 in year 12, and level 3 in year 13, but it is possible for students to gain multiple levels in a single year. This data is organized to show the number of students gaining each type of certification (broken out by gender) across each of the 3 years. There are many blank cells that provide ample space to see the data, and all of the necessary variables are represented: there are essentially three 2x3 tables showing the number of students attaining each NCEA level in each year of school. If all of the information is present in this table, is there really a problem? Perhaps not if the goal is just to display the data, but analyzing this data effectively, or plotting it in a way that is useful, requires some restructuring. @fig-machine-readable shows a restructured version of this data in a more compact rectangular format.\n\n![Spreadsheet reorganized for data analysis](images/data-transformations/Data-machine-consumption.png){#fig-machine-readable}\n\nIn @fig-machine-readable, each column contains one variable: Year, gender, level, and total number of students. Each row contains one observation. We still have 18 data points, but this format is optimized for statistical analysis, rather than to display for (human) visual consumption. We will refer to this restructured data as \"tidy\" data: it has a single column for each variable and a single row for each observation.\n\n### Defining Tidy data\n\nThe illustrations below are lifted from an [excellent blog post](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/10/12/tidy-data/) [@lowndesTidyDataEfficiency2020] about tidy data; they're reproduced here because\n\n1.  they're beautiful and licensed as CCA-4.0-by, and\n2.  they might be more memorable than the equivalent paragraphs of text without illustration.\n\nMost of the time, data does not come in a format suitable for analysis. Spreadsheets are generally optimized for data entry or viewing, rather than for statistical analysis:\n\n-   Tables may be laid out for easy data entry, so that there are multiple observations in a single row\n-   It may be visually preferable to arrange columns of data to show multiple times or categories on the same row for easy comparison\n\nWhen we analyze data, however, we care much more about the fundamental structure of observations: discrete units of data collection. Each observation may have several corresponding variables that may be measured simultaneously, but fundamentally each discrete data point is what we are interested in analyzing.\n\nThe structure of **tidy data** reflects this preference for keeping the data in a fundamental form: each observation is in its own row, any observed variables are in single columns. This format is inherently rectangular, which is also important for statistical analysis - our methods are typically designed to work with matrices of data.\n\n![Tidy data format, illustrated.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_1.jpg){#fig-tidy-data-definition}\n\n![An illustration of the principle that every messy dataset is messy in its own way.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_2.jpg)\n\nThe preference for tidy data has several practical implications: it is easier to reuse code on tidy data, allowing for analysis using a standardized set of tools (rather than having to build a custom tool for each data analysis job).\n\n![Tidy data is easier to manage because the same tools and approaches apply to multiple datasets.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_3.jpg)\n\nIn addition, standardized tools for data analysis means that it is easier to collaborate with others: if everyone starts with the same set of assumptions about the dataset, you can borrow methods and tools from a collaborator's analysis and easily apply them to your own dataset.\n\n::: {#fig-tidy-data-advantages layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Collaboration with tidy data.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_4.jpg){fig-alt=\"Two tidyverse monsters collaborating on a tidy dataset using similarly-shaped tools.\"}\n\n![Tidy data enables standardized workflows.](https://www.openscapes.org/img/blog/tidydata/tidydata_5.jpg){fig-alt=\"A tidy data analysis conveyor belt, with new data loaded onto the conveyor that is sequentially wrangled, visualized, modeled, and leaves the conveyor belt as a complete analysis.\"}\n\nTidy data makes it easier to collaborate with others and analyze new data using standardized workflows.\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\n\n### Examples: Messy Data {-}\n\n\n\n\n\nThese datasets all display the same data: TB cases documented by the WHO in Afghanistan, Brazil, and China, between 1999 and 2000. There are 4 variables: country, year, cases, and population, but each table has a different layout.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### Table 1 {-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Table 1\n\n|country     | year|  cases| population|\n|:-----------|----:|------:|----------:|\n|Afghanistan | 1999|    745|   19987071|\n|Afghanistan | 2000|   2666|   20595360|\n|Brazil      | 1999|  37737|  172006362|\n|Brazil      | 2000|  80488|  174504898|\n|China       | 1999| 212258| 1272915272|\n|China       | 2000| 213766| 1280428583|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, each observation is a single row, each variable is a column, and everything is nicely arranged for e.g. regression or statistical analysis. We can easily compute another measure, such as cases per 100,000 population, by taking cases/population * 100000 (this would define a new column). \n\n#### 2 {-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Table 2\n\n|country     | year|type       |      count|\n|:-----------|----:|:----------|----------:|\n|Afghanistan | 1999|cases      |        745|\n|Afghanistan | 1999|population |   19987071|\n|Afghanistan | 2000|cases      |       2666|\n|Afghanistan | 2000|population |   20595360|\n|Brazil      | 1999|cases      |      37737|\n|Brazil      | 1999|population |  172006362|\n|Brazil      | 2000|cases      |      80488|\n|Brazil      | 2000|population |  174504898|\n|China       | 1999|cases      |     212258|\n|China       | 1999|population | 1272915272|\n|China       | 2000|cases      |     213766|\n|China       | 2000|population | 1280428583|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, we have 4 columns again, but we now have 12 rows: one of the columns is an indicator of which of two numerical observations is recorded in that row; a second column stores the value. This form of the data is more easily plotted in e.g. ggplot2, if we want to show lines for both cases and population, but computing per capita cases would be much more difficult in this form than in the arrangement in table 1. \n\n#### 3 {-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Table 3\n\n|country     | year|rate              |\n|:-----------|----:|:-----------------|\n|Afghanistan | 1999|745/19987071      |\n|Afghanistan | 2000|2666/20595360     |\n|Brazil      | 1999|37737/172006362   |\n|Brazil      | 2000|80488/174504898   |\n|China       | 1999|212258/1272915272 |\n|China       | 2000|213766/1280428583 |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis form has only 3 columns, because the rate variable (which is a character) stores both the case count and the population.

There are many different \"levels\" of working with strings in programming, from simple find-and-replaced of fixed (constant) strings to regular expressions, which are extremely powerful (and extremely complicated). \n\n> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems. - Jamie Zawinski\n\n![Alternately, the xkcd version of the above quote](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/perl_problems.png)\n\n\n### Common, simple string tasks\n\n#### Parsing numbers {-}\n\nOne of the most common tasks when reading in and tidying messy data is that numeric-ish data can come in many forms that are read (by default) as strings.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-parse-numbers .cell tbl-cap='Different \"messy\" number formats'}\n      string_col    int_col    float_col  mix_col      missing_col  money_col    boolean_col    custom\n--  ------------  ---------  -----------  ---------  -------------  -----------  -------------  --------\n 0             1          1          1.1  a                      1  £1,000.00    True           Y\n 1             2          2          1.2  2                      2  £2,400.00    False          Y\n 2             3          3          1.3  3                      3  £2,400.00    True           N\n 3             4          4          4.7  4                    nan  £2,400.00    True           N\n:::\n\n\n#### Find and replace\n\n\n### Separating multi-variable columns\n\n### Joining columns\n\n### Regular Expressions\nMatching exact strings is easy - it's just like using find and replace.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhuman_talk <- \"blah, blah, blah.

You can get by without regular expressions if you're creative, but often they're much simpler. \n\nYou may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this [web  app](https://spannbaueradam.shinyapps.io/r_regex_tester/) built to test R regular expressions for R. A similar application for Perl compatible regular expressions (used by SAS and Python) can be found [here](https://regex101.com/). The subset of regular expression syntax we're going to cover here is fairly limited (and common to SAS, Python, and R, with a few adjustments), but [you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/regex?tab=Votes). As with any tool, there are situations where it's useful, and situations where you should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to. \n\nHere are the basics of regular expressions:\n\n- `[]` enclose sets of characters    \nEx: `[abc]` will match any single character `a`, `b`, `c`\n  - `-` specifies a range of characters (`A-z` matches all upper and lower case letters)\n  - to match `-` exactly, precede with a backslash (outside of `[]`) or put the `-` last (inside `[]`)\n- `.` matches any character (except a newline)\n- To match special characters, escape them using `\\` (in most languages) or `\\\\` (in R). So `\\\\.` will match a literal `.`, `\\\\$` will match a literal `$`. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R {-}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnum_string <- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\nssn <- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\")\n## Error in str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nssn\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'ssn' not found\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Python {-}\n\nXXX TODO XXX\n\n:::\n\nListing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify repetition?\n\n- `*` means repeat between 0 and inf times\n- `+` means 1 or more times\n- `?` means 0 or 1 times -- most useful when you're looking for something optional\n- `{a, b}` means repeat between `a` and `b` times, where `a` and `b` are integers. `b` can be blank. So `[abc]{3,}` will match `abc`, `aaaa`, `cbbaa`, but not `ab`, `bb`, or `a`. For a single number of repeated characters, you can use `{a}`. So `{3, }` means \"3 or more times\" and `{3}` means \"exactly 3 times\"\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R {-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_extract(\"banana\", \"[a-z]{1,}\") # match any sequence of lowercase characters\n## Error in str_extract(\"banana\", \"[a-z]{1,}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nstr_extract(\"banana\", \"[ab]{1,}\") # Match any sequence of a and b characters\n## Error in str_extract(\"banana\", \"[ab]{1,}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nstr_extract_all(\"banana\", \"(..)\") # Match any two characters\n## Error in str_extract_all(\"banana\", \"(..)\"): could not find function \"str_extract_all\"\nstr_extract(\"banana\", \"(..)\\\\1\") # Match a repeated thing\n## Error in str_extract(\"banana\", \"(..)\\\\1\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnum_string <- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789, bank account balance: $50,000,000.23\"\n\nssn <- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\")\n## Error in str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nssn\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'ssn' not found\nphone <- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}\")\n## Error in str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nphone\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'phone' not found\nnuid <- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{8}\")\n## Error in str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{8}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nnuid\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'nuid' not found\nbank_balance <- str_extract(num_string, \"\\\\$[0-9,]+\\\\.[0-9]{2}\")\n## Error in str_extract(num_string, \"\\\\$[0-9,]+\\\\.[0-9]{2}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nbank_balance\n## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'bank_balance' not found\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Python {-}\n\nXXX TODO XXX\n\n:::\n\n\nThere are also ways to \"anchor\" a pattern to a part of the string (e.g. the beginning or the end)\n\n- `^` has multiple meanings:\n  - if it's the first character in a pattern, `^` matches the beginning of a string\n  - if it follows `[`, e.g. `[^abc]`, `^` means \"not\" - for instance, \"the collection of all characters that aren't a, b, or c\". \n- `$` means the end of a string\n\nCombined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of semi-structured string data, such as addresses.\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n#### R {-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naddress <- \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500\"\n\nhouse_num <- str_extract(address, \"^[0-9]{1,}\")\n## Error in str_extract(address, \"^[0-9]{1,}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\n\n # Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma\nstreet <- str_extract(address, \"[A-z0-9 ]{1,}\")\n## Error in str_extract(address, \"[A-z0-9 ]{1,}\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\nstreet <- str_remove(street, house_num) %>% str_trim() # remove house number\n## Error in str_trim(.): could not find function \"str_trim\"\n\ncity <- str_extract(address, \",.*,\") %>% str_remove_all(\",\") %>% str_trim()\n## Error in str_trim(.): could not find function \"str_trim\"\n\nzip <- str_extract(address, \"[0-9-]{5,10}$\") # match 5 and 9 digit zip codes\n## Error in str_extract(address, \"[0-9-]{5,10}$\"): could not find function \"str_extract\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Python {-}\n\nXXX TODO XXX\n\n:::\n\n\n\n- `()` are used to capture information.
