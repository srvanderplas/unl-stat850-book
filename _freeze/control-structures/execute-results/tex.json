This will be useful for both data structures and control structures, so stick with me for a few minutes.\n\n### And, Or, and Not\n\nWe can combine logical statements using and, or, and not.\n\n-   (X AND Y) requires that both X and Y are true.\n-   (X OR Y) requires that one of X or Y is true.\n-   (NOT X) is true if X is false, and false if X is true. Sometimes called **negation**.\n\nIn R, we use `!` to symbolize NOT, in Python, we use `~` for vector-wise negation (NOT).\n\nOrder of operations dictates that NOT is applied before other operations. So `NOT X AND Y` is read as `(NOT X) AND (Y)`. You must use parentheses to change the way this is interpreted.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### R\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\ny <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n\nx & y # AND\n## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\nx | y # OR\n## [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n!x & y # NOT X AND Y\n## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\nx & !y # X AND NOT Y\n## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Python\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.array([True, False, True, False])\ny = np.array([True, True, False, False])\n\nx & y\n## array([ True, False, False, False])\nx | y\n## array([ True,  True,  True, False])\n~x & y\n## array([False,  True, False, False])\nx & ~y\n## array([False, False,  True, False])\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### De Morgan's Laws\n\n[De Morgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) are a set of rules for how to combine logical statements. You can represent them in a number of ways:\n\n-   NOT(A or B) is equivalent to NOT(A) and NOT(B)\n-   NOT(A and B) is equivalent to NOT(A) or NOT(B)\n\n::: panel-tabset\nWe can also represent them with Venn Diagrams.\n\n#### Definitions\n\n![Venn Diagram of Set A and Set B](images/control-structures/SetA%20and%20SetB.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\nSuppose that we set the convention that \n\n![Shaded regions are TRUE, unshaded regions are FALSE](images/control-structures/TrueFalse.png){width=\"20%\"}\n\n#### DeMorgan's First Law\n\n![A venn diagram illustration of De Morgan's laws showing that the region that is outside of the union of A OR B (aka NOT (A OR B)) is the same as the region that is outside of (NOT A) and (NOT B)](images/control-structures/DeMorgan1.png)\n\n#### DeMorgan's Second Law\n\n![A venn diagram illustration of De Morgan's laws showing that the region that is outside of the union of A AND B (aka NOT (A AND B)) is the same as the region that is outside of (NOT A) OR (NOT B)](images/control-structures/DeMorgan2.png)\n:::\n\nDeMorgan's laws become very useful when you are writing complex conditional statements. They're basically the distributive rule of conditional statements and can help you simplify complex conditions.\n\n\n## Conditional (If) Statements\n\nConditional statements determine if code is evaluated.\n\nThey look like this:\n\n    if (condition)\n      then\n        (thing to do)\n      else\n        (other thing to do)\n\nThe else (other thing to do) part may be omitted.\n\nWhen this statement is read by the computer, the computer checks to see if condition is true or false. If the condition is true, then (thing to do) is also run. If the condition is false, then (other thing to do) is run instead.\n\nLet's try this out:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 3\ny <- 1\n\nif (x > 2) { \n  y <- 8\n} else {\n  y <- 4\n}\n\nprint(paste(\"x =\", x, \"; y =\", y))\n## [1] \"x = 3 ; y = 8\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn R, the logical condition after `if` must be in parentheses. It is common to then enclose the statement to be run if the condition is true in `{}` so that it is clear what code matches the if statement. You can technically put the condition on the line after the `if (x > 2)` line, and everything will still work, but then it gets hard to figure out what to do with the else statement - it technically would also go on the same line, and that gets hard to read.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 3\ny <- 1\n\nif (x > 2) y <- 8 else y <- 4\n\nprint(paste(\"x =\", x, \"; y =\", y))\n## [1] \"x = 3 ; y = 8\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSo while the 2nd version of the code technically works, the first version with the brackets is much easier to read and understand. Please try to emulate the first version!\n\n### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nx = 3\ny = 1\n\nif x > 2:\n  y = 8\nelse:\n  y = 4\n\nprint(\"x =\", x, \"; y =\", y)\n## x = 3 ; y = 8\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn python, all code grouping is accomplished with spaces instead of with brackets. So in python, we write our if statement as `if x > 2:` with the colon indicating that what follows is the code to evaluate. The next line is indented with 2 spaces to show that the code on those lines belongs to that if statement. Then, we use the else: statement to provide an alternative set of code to run if the logical condition in the if statement is false. Again, we indent the code under the else statement to show where it \"belongs\".\n\nPython will throw errors if you mess up the spacing. This is one thing that is very annoying about Python... but it's a consequence of trying to make the code more readable.\n\n<!-- https://www.py4e.com/html3/03-conditional -->\n:::\n\n### Representing Conditional Statements as Diagrams\n\nA common way to represent conditional logic is to draw a flow chart diagram.\n\nIn a flow chart, conditional statements are represented as diamonds, and other code is represented as a rectangle. Yes/no or True/False branches are labeled. Typically, after a conditional statement, the program flow returns to a single point.\n\n![Program flow diagram outline of a simple if/else statement](images/control-structures/flow-chart1.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n### Try it out! {.unnumbered}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Problem {.unnumbered}\n\nThe US Tax code has brackets, such that the first \\$10,275 of your income is taxed at 10%, anything between \\$10,275 and \\$41,775 is taxed at 12%, and so on.\n\nHere is the table of tax brackets for single filers in 2022:\n\n| rate | Income                 |\n|------|------------------------|\n| 10%  | \\$0 to \\$10,275        |\n| 12%  | \\$10,275 to \\$41,775   |\n| 22%  | \\$41,775 to \\$89,075   |\n| 24%  | \\$89,075 to \\$170,050  |\n| 32%  | \\$170,050 to \\$215,950 |\n| 35%  | \\$215,950 to \\$539,900 |\n| 37%  | \\$539,900 or more      |\n\nNote: For the purposes of this problem, we're ignoring the personal exemption and the standard deduction, so we're already simplifying the tax code.\n\nWrite a set of if statements that assess someone's income and determine what their overall tax rate is.\n\nHint: You may want to keep track of how much of the income has already been taxed in a variable and what the total tax accumulation is in another variable.\n\n#### R Solution {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Start with total income\nincome <- 200000\n\n# x will hold income that hasn't been taxed yet\nx <- income\n# y will hold taxes paid\ny <- 0\n\nif (x <= 10275) {\n  y <- x*.1 # tax paid\n  x <- 0 # All money has been taxed\n} else {\n  y <- y + 10275 * .1\n  x <- x - 10275 # Money remaining that hasn't been taxed\n}\n\nif (x <= (41775 - 10275)) {\n  y <- y + x * .12\n  x <- 0\n} else {\n  y <- y + (41775 - 10275) * .12\n  x <- x - (41775 - 10275) \n}\n\nif (x <= (89075 - 41775)) {\n  y <- y + x * .22\n  x <- 0\n} else {\n  y <- y + (89075 - 41775) * .22\n  x <- x - (89075 - 41775)\n}\n\nif (x <= (170050 - 89075)) {\n  y <- y + x * .24\n  x <- 0\n} else {\n  y <- y + (170050 - 89075) * .24\n  x <- x - (170050 - 89075)\n}\n\nif (x <= (215950 - 170050)) {\n  y <- y + x * .32\n  x <- 0\n} else {\n  y <- y + (215950 - 170050) * .32\n  x <- x - (215950 - 170050)\n}\n\nif (x <= (539900 - 215950)) {\n  y <- y + x * .35\n  x <- 0\n} else {\n  y <- y + (539900 - 215950) * .35\n  x <- x - (539900 - 215950)\n}\n\nif (x > 0) {\n  y <- y + x * .37\n}\n\n\nprint(paste(\"Total Tax Rate on $\", income, \" in income = \", round(y/income, 4)*100, \"%\"))\n## [1] \"Total Tax Rate on $ 2e+05  in income =  22.12 %\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Python Solution {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n# Start with total income\nincome = 200000\n\n# untaxed will hold income that hasn't been taxed yet\nuntaxed = income\n# taxed will hold taxes paid\ntaxes = 0\n\nif untaxed <= 10275:\n  taxes = untaxed*.1 # tax paid\n  untaxed = 0 # All money has been taxed\nelse:\n  taxes = taxes + 10275 * .1\n  untaxed = untaxed - 10275 # money remaining that hasn't been taxed\n\nif untaxed <= (41775 - 10275):\n  taxes = taxes + untaxed * .12\n  untaxed = 0\nelse:\n  taxes = taxes + (41775 - 10275) * .12\n  untaxed = untaxed - (41775 - 10275) \n\n\nif untaxed <= (89075 - 41775):\n  taxes = taxes + untaxed * .22\n  untaxed = 0\nelse: \n  taxes = taxes + (89075 - 41775) * .22\n  untaxed = untaxed - (89075 - 41775)\n\nif untaxed <= (170050 - 89075):\n  taxes = taxes + untaxed * .24\n  untaxed = 0\nelse: \n  taxes = taxes + (170050 - 89075) * .24\n  untaxed = untaxed - (170050 - 89075)\n\nif untaxed <= (215950 - 170050):\n  taxes = taxes + untaxed * .32\n  untaxed = 0\nelse:\n  taxes = taxes + (215950 - 170050) * .32\n  untaxed = untaxed - (215950 - 170050)\n\nif untaxed <= (539900 - 215950):\n  taxes = taxes + untaxed * .35\n  untaxed = 0\nelse: \n  taxes = taxes + (539900 - 215950) * .35\n  untaxed = untaxed - (539900 - 215950)\n\n\nif untaxed > 0:\n  taxes = taxes + untaxed * .37\n\n\n\nprint(\"Total Tauntaxed Rate on $\", income, \" in income = \", round(taxes/income, 4)*100, \"%\")\n## Total Tauntaxed Rate on $ 200000  in income =  22.12 %\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe will find a better way to represent this calculation once we discuss loops - we can store each bracket's start and end point in a vector and loop through them. Any time you find yourself copy-pasting code and changing values, you should consider using a loop (or eventually a function) instead.\n\n\n#### Program Flow Chart\n\nLet's explore using program flow maps for a slightly more complicated problem: The tax bracket example that we just used to try out if statement syntax.\n\n<!-- First, let's start by looking at a graph of the practical implication of taxing things using brackets. This graph shows the amount in each bracket as well as the amount of taxes paid. -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n![The control flow diagram for the code in the previous example](images/control-structures/tax-brackets.png)\n\nControl flow diagrams can be extremely helpful when figuring out how programs work (and where gaps in your logic are when you're debugging). It can be very helpful to map out your program flow as you're untangling a problem.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Chaining Conditional Statements: Else-If\n\nIn many cases, it can be helpful to have a long chain of conditional statements describing a sequence of alternative statements.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n#### Example: Age Brackets\nFor instance, suppose I want to determine what categorical age bracket someone falls into based on their numerical age. All of the bins are mutually exclusive - you can't be in the 25-40 bracket and the 41-55 bracket.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### Program Flow Map {.unnumbered}\n\n![Program flow map for a series of mutually exclusive categories. If our goal is to take a numeric age variable and create a categorical set of age brackets, such as \\<18, 18-25, 26-40, 41-55, 56-65, and \\>65, we can do this with a series of if-else statements chained together. Only one of the bracket assignments is evaluated, so it is important to place the most restrictive condition first.](images/control-structures/age-category-prog-flow.png)\n\nThe important thing to realize when examining this program flow map is that if `age <= 18` is true, then **none of the other conditional statements even get evaluated**. That is, once a statement is true, none of the other statements matter. Because of this, it is important to place the most restrictive statement first.\n\n![Program flow map for a series of mutually exclusive categories, emphasizing that only some statements are evaluated.

Loops can be written in several different ways, but all loops allow for executing a block of code a variable number of times.\n\n### While Loops\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed conditional statements, where a block of code is only executed *if* a logical statement is true.\n\nThe simplest type of loop is the **while** loop, which executes a block of code until a statement is no longer true.\n\n![Flow map showing while-loop pseudocode (while x \\<= N) { \\# code that changes x in some way} and the program flow map expansion where we check if x \\> N (exiting the loop if true); otherwise, we continue into the loop, execute the main body of #code and then change x and start over.](images/control-structures/while-loop-flow.png)\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 0\n\nwhile (x < 10) { \n  # Everything in here is executed \n  # during each iteration of the loop\n  print(x)\n  x <- x + 1\n}\n## [1] 0\n## [1] 1\n## [1] 2\n## [1] 3\n## [1] 4\n## [1] 5\n## [1] 6\n## [1] 7\n## [1] 8\n## [1] 9\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nx = 0\n\nwhile x < 10:\n  print(x)\n  x = x + 1\n## 0\n## 1\n## 2\n## 3\n## 4\n## 5\n## 6\n## 7\n## 8\n## 9\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n#### While Loops: Try it Out! {.unnumbered}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### Problem {.unnumbered}\n\nWrite a while loop that verifies that $$\\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\prod_{k=1}^N \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right) = \\frac{e^\\pi - e^{-\\pi}}{2\\pi}.$$\n\nTerminate your loop when you get within 0.0001 of $\\frac{e^\\pi - e^{-\\pi}}{2\\pi}$. At what value of $k$ is this point reached?\n\n##### Math Notation {.unnumbered}\n\nBreaking down math notation for code:\n\n-   If you are unfamiliar with the notation $\\prod_{k=1}^N f(k)$, this is the product of $f(k)$ for $k = 1, 2, ..., N$, $$f(1)\\cdot f(2)\\cdot ... \\cdot f(N)$$\n\n-   To evaluate a limit, we just keep increasing $N$ until we get arbitrarily close to the right hand side of the equation.\n\nIn this problem, we can just keep increasing $k$ and keep track of the cumulative product. So we define `k=1`, `prod = 1`, and `ans` before the loop starts. Then, we loop over `k`, multiplying `prod` by $(1 + 1/k^2)$ and then incrementing $k$ by one each time. At each iteration, we test whether `prod` is close enough to `ans` to stop the loop.\n\n##### R Solution {.unnumbered}\n\nIn R, you will use `pi` and `exp()` - these are available by default without any additional libraries or packages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk <- 1\nprod <- 1\nans <- (exp(pi) - exp(-pi))/(2*pi)\ndelta <- 0.0001\n\nwhile (abs(prod - ans) >= 0.0001) {\n  prod <- prod * (1 + 1/k^2)\n  k <- k + 1\n}\n\nk\n## [1] 36761\nprod\n## [1] 3.675978\nans\n## [1] 3.676078\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python solution {.unnumbered}\n\nNote that in python, you will have to import the math library to get the values of pi and the `exp` function.

In a for loop, we run the block of code, iterating through a series of values (commonly, one to N, but not always). Generally speaking, for loops are known as **definite** loops because the code inside a for loop is executed a specific number of times. While loops are known as **indefinite** loops because the code within a while loop is evaluated until the condition is falsified, which is not always a known number of times.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n##### Flow Map {.unnumbered}\n\n![Flow map showing for-loop pseudocode (for j in 1 to N) { \\# code} and the program flow map expansion where j starts at 1 and we check if j \\> N (exiting the loop if true); otherwise, we continue into the loop, execute the main body of #code and then increment j and start over.](images/control-structures/for-loop-flow.png)\n\n##### R {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfor (i in 1:5 ) {\n  print(i)\n}\n## [1] 1\n## [1] 2\n## [1] 3\n## [1] 4\n## [1] 5\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nfor i in range(5):\n  print(i)\n## 0\n## 1\n## 2\n## 3\n## 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nBy default `range`(5) goes from 0 to 5, the upper bound.

Infinite loops never exit, because the condition is always true.

Throughout this course, you've used a bunch of different functions in R and python that are built into the language or added through packages: `mean`, `ggplot`, `length`, `print`. In this chapter, we'll be writing our own functions.\n\n### When to write a function?\n\nIf you've written the same code (with a few minor changes, like variable names) more than twice, you should probably write a function instead. There are a few benefits to this rule:\n\n1. Your code stays neater (and shorter), so it is easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n\n2. If you need to fix the code because of errors, you only have to do it in one place.\n\n3. You can re-use code in other files by keeping functions you need regularly in a file (or if you're really awesome, in your own package!)\n\n4. If you name your functions well, your code becomes easier to understand thanks to grouping a set of actions under a descriptive function name.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### Learn more about functions\n\nThere is some extensive material on this subject in R for Data Science [@r4ds] on [functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html).

Then, you simplify the code as much as possible. Only at the end of that process do you create an actual function.\n\n:::\n\n\n### Syntax\n\n![R and python syntax for defining functions. Portions of the command that indicate the function name, function scope, and return statement are highlighted in each block.](images/control-structures/Annotating_function_syntax.png)\n\nIn R, functions are defined as other variables, using `<-`, but we specify the arguments a function takes by using the `function()` statement. The contents of the function are contained within `{` and `}`. If the function returns a value, a `return()` statement can be used; alternately, if there is no return statement, the last computation in the function will be returned.\n\nIn python, functions are defined using the `def` command, with the function name, parentheses, and the function arguments to follow. The first line of the function definition ends with a `:`, and all subsequent lines of the function are indented (this is how python knows where the end of the function is). A python function return statement is `return <value>`, with no parentheses needed.\n\nNote that in python, the `return` statement is not optional. It is not uncommon to have python functions that don't return anything; in R, this is a bit less common, for reasons we won't get into here.\n\n### Arguments and Parameters\n\nAn **argument** is the name for the object you pass into a function.\n\nA **parameter** is the name for the object once it is inside the function (or the name of the thing as defined in the function).\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n#### Example: Parts of a Function\n\nLet's examine the difference between arguments and parameters by writing a function that takes a puppy's name and returns \"<name> is a good pup!\".\n\n:::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n#### R {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndog <- \"Eddie\"\n\ngoodpup <- function(name) {\n  paste(name, \"is a good pup!\")\n}\n\ngoodpup(dog)\n## [1] \"Eddie is a good pup!\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this example R function, when we call `goodpup(dog)`, `dog` is the argument. `name` is the parameter. \n\n#### Python {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ndog = \"Eddie\"\n\ndef goodpup(name):\n  return name + \" is a good pup!\"\n\ngoodpup(dog)\n## 'Eddie is a good pup!'\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this example python function, when we call `goodpup(dog)`, `dog` is the argument. `name` is the parameter. \n\n::::\n\nWhat is happening inside the computer's memory as `goodpup` runs?\n\n![A sketch of the execution of the program `goodpup`, showing that `name` is only defined within the local environment that is created while `goodpup` is running. We can never access `name` in our global environment.](images/control-structures/function_argument_parameters.png)\n\n:::\n\nThis is why the distinction between **arguments** and **parameters** matters. Parameters are only accessible while inside of the function - and in that local environment, we need to call the object by the parameter name, not the name we use outside the function (the argument name). \n\nWe can even call a function with an argument that isn't defined outside of the function call: `goodpup(\"Tesla\")` produces \"Tesla is a good pup!\". Here, I do not have a variable storing the string \"Tesla\", but I can make the function run anyways. So \"Tesla\" here is an argument to `goodpup` but it is not a variable in my environment.\n\nThis is a confusing set of concepts and it's ok if you only just sort of get what I'm trying to explain here. Hopefully it will become more clear as you write more code.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Try it out: Function Parts {-}\n\nFor each of the following blocks of code, identify the function name, function arguments, parameter names, and return statements.

As you might imagine, this can quickly get confusing as the number of parameters in the function increases.\n\nIn this case, it can be simpler to use the parameter names when you pass in arguments.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n#### R  {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndivide(3, 6)\n## [1] 0.5\n\ndivide(x = 3, y = 6)\n## [1] 0.5\n\ndivide(y = 6, x = 3)\n## [1] 0.5\n\ndivide(6, 3)\n## [1] 2\n\ndivide(x = 6, y = 3)\n## [1] 2\n\ndivide(y = 3, x = 6)\n## [1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Python {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ndivide(3, 6)\n## 0.5\ndivide(x = 3, y = 6)\n## 0.5\ndivide(y = 6, x = 3)\n## 0.5\ndivide(6, 3)\n## 2.0\ndivide(x = 6, y = 3)\n## 2.0\ndivide(y = 3, x = 6)\n## 2.0\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\nAs you can see, the order of the arguments doesn't much matter, as long as you use named arguments, but if you don't name your arguments, the order very much matters.\n\n### Input Validation\n\nWhen you write a function, you often assume that your parameters will be of a certain type. But you can't guarantee that the person using your function knows that they need a certain type of input. In these cases, it's best to **validate** your function input.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n#### Input Validation Example {-}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### R {-}\n\nIn R, you can use `stopifnot()` to check for certain essential conditions. If you want to provide a more illuminating error message, you can check your conditions using `if()` and then use `stop(\"better error message\")` in the body of the if statement. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd <- function(x, y) {\n  x + y\n}\n\nadd(\"tmp\", 3)\n## Error in x + y: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\nadd <- function(x, y) {\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(y))\n  x + y\n}\n\nadd(\"tmp\", 3)\n## Error in add(\"tmp\", 3): is.numeric(x) is not TRUE\nadd(3, 4)\n## [1] 7\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {-}\n\nIn Python, the easiest way to handle errors is to use a try statement, which operates rather like an if statement: if the statement executes, then we're good to go; if not, we can use `except` to handle different types of errors. The `else` clause is there to handle anything that needs to happen if the statement in the `try` clause executes without any errors.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n\ndef add(x, y):\n  x + y\n\nadd(\"tmp\", 3)\n## Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\ndef add(x, y):\n  try:\n    return x + y\n  except TypeError:\n    print(\"x and y must be add-able\")\n  else:\n    # We should never get here, because the try clause has a return statement\n    print(\"Else clause?\")\n  return\n\nadd(\"tmp\", 3)\n## x and y must be add-able\nadd(3, 4)\n## 7\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can read more about error handling in Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nInput validation is one aspect of **defensive programming** - programming in such a way that you try to ensure that your programs don't error out due to unexpected bugs by anticipating ways your programs might be misunderstood or misused [@DefensiveProgramming2022].\n\n\n### Scope\n\nWhen talking about functions, for the first time we start to confront a critical concept in programming, which is scope. **Scope** is the part of the program where the name you've given a variable is valid - that is, where you can use a variable.\n\n> A variable is only available from inside the region it is created.\n\nWhat do I mean by the part of a program? The **lexical scope** is the portion of the code (the set of lines of code) where the name is valid.\n\nThe concept of scope is best demonstrated through a series of examples, so in the rest of this section, I'll show you some examples of how scope works and the concepts that help you figure out what \"scope\" actually means in practice.\n\n\n#### Name Masking\n\nScope is most clearly demonstrated when we use the same variable name inside and outside a function. Note that this is 1) bad programming practice, and 2) fairly easily avoided if you can make your names even slightly more creative than `a`, `b`, and so on. But, for the purposes of demonstration, I hope you'll forgive my lack of creativity in this area so that you can see how name masking works.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\nWhat does this function return, 10 or 20? \n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### Pseudocode {-}\n\n```\na = 10\n\nmyfun = function() {\n  a = 20\n  return a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n```\n\n##### Sketch {-}\n\n![A sketch of the global environment as well as the environment within `myfun()`. Because `a=20` inside `myfun()`, when we call `myfun()`, we get the value of `a` within that environment, instead of within the global environment.](images/control-structures/function-scope.png)\n\n##### R {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 10\n\nmyfun <- function() {\n  a <- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n## [1] 20\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n\na = 10\n\ndef myfun():\n  a = 20\n  return a\n\nmyfun()\n## 20\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe lexical scope of the function is the area that is between the braces (in R) or the indented region (in python). Outside the function, `a` has the value of 10, but inside the function, `a` has the value of 20. So when we call `myfun()`, we get 20, because the scope of `myfun` is the **local context** where `a` is evaluated, and the value of `a` in that environment dominates.\n\nThis is an example of **name masking**, where names defined inside of a function mask names defined outside of a function.\n\n\n#### Environments and Scope\n\nAnother principle of scoping is that if you call a function and then call the same function again, the function's environment is re-created each time. Each function call is unrelated to the next function call when the function is defined using local variables.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### Pseudocode {-}\n\n```\nmyfun = function() {\n  if a is not defined\n    a = 1\n  else\n    a = a + 1\n}\n\nmyfun()\nmyfun()\n\n```\n\nWhat does this output?\n\n##### Sketch {-}\n\n![When we define myfun, we create a template for an environment with variables and code to excecute. Each time `myfun()` is called, that template is used to create a new environment. This prevents successive calls to `myfun()` from affecting each other -- which means `a = 1` every time.](images/control-structures/function-scope-environment.png)\n\n\n##### R {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmyfun <- function() {\n  if (!exists(\"aa\")) {\n    aa <- 1\n  } else {\n    aa <- aa + 1\n  }\n  return(aa)\n}\n\nmyfun()\n## [1] 1\nmyfun()\n## [1] 1\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\ndef myfun():\n  try: aa\n  except NameError: aa = 1\n  else: aa = aa + 1\n  return aa\n\nmyfun()\n## 1\nmyfun()\n## 1\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that the `try` command here is used to handle the case where a doesn't exist. If there is a NameError (which will happen if `aa` is not defined) then we define `aa = 1`, if there is not a NameError, then `aa = aa + 1`. \n\nThis is necessary because [Python does not have a built-in way to test if a variable exists before it is used](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook/0596001673/ch17s02.html) [@martelliPythonCookbook2002, Ch 17].\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### Dynamic Lookup\n\nScoping determines where to look for values -- when, however, is determined by the sequence of steps in the code. When a function is called, the **calling environment** (the global environment or set of environments at the time the function is called) determines what values are used. \n\nIf an object doesn't exist in the function's environment, the global environment will be searched next; if there is no object in the global environment, the program will error out. This behavior, combined with changes in the calling environment over time, can mean that the output of a function can change based on objects outside of the function.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##### Pseudocode {-}\n\n```\nmyfun = function() x + 1\n\nx = 14\n\nmyfun()\n\nx = 20\n\nmyfun()\n\n```\n\nWhat will the output be of this code?\n\n##### Sketch {-}\n\n![The state of the global environment at the time the function is called (that is, the state of the calling environment) can change the results of the function](images/control-structures/function-scope-calling-environment.png)\n\n\n##### R {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmyfun <- function() {\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx <- 14\n\nmyfun()\n## [1] 15\n\nx <- 20\n\nmyfun()\n## [1] 21\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Python {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\n\ndef myfun():\n  return x + 1\n\n\nx = 14\n\nmyfun()\n## 15\nx = 20\n\nmyfun()\n## 21\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n#### Try It Out: Function Scope {-}\n\nWhat does the following function return?
