That's awful, and boring^[If you want boring, or have insomnia, check out [this Microsoft Word tutorial from 1989](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk71bPz5VLo). Youtube says it's the most boring video ever made.], and honestly, as painful for me to have to listen to myself while editing the things as it is for you to watch them.\n\nInstead, I hope  that you'll be able to work through this book, week by week, over the course of Stat 850. I've included comics, snark, gifs, YouTube videos, and more, with the goal of making this a collection of the best information I could find on learning some combination of R, SAS, Python, and general statistical programming. \n\nIn Fall 2020 and Fall 2021, this class covered R and SAS. The department is now transitioning away from SAS, so this semester the class will be primarily taught in R. I will leave some information about SAS and Python for you along the way, if you're working in those languages, but my goal at this point is to transition the course so that it covers R and Python. \n\n\n## Course Description {-}\n\nIntroductions to statistical computing packages and document preparation software. Topics include: graphical techniques, data management, Monte Carlo simulation, dynamic document preparation, presentation software.\n\n## Course Goals {-}\n\n(Broad, amorphous conceptual things that are hard to measure)\n\n1. Learn how to use a statistical programming language for data analysis, data processing, and data visualization.\n\n2. Become familiar with the process, techniques, and goals of exploratory data analysis.\n\n3. Create, assess, and debug code effectively.\n\n    i. Use online resources to find software to perform a task, comparing approaches taken by competing programs.\n    \n    ii. Read error messages, find related problems in online forums, and isolate the conditions necessary to generate the error.\n    \n    iii. Generate minimum working examples or reproducible examples of errors in order to ask for help effectively.\n\n4. Communicate statistical results using reproducible, dynamic tools. Understand the importance of reproducibility in scientific computation.\n\n## Course Objectives {-}\n\n(what you should be able to do at the end of this course)\n\nA. Clean and format the data appropriately for the intended analysis or visualization method. (Goals: 1)\n\nB. Explore a data set using numerical and visual summaries, developing questions which can be answered using statistics. (Goals: 1, 2)\n\nC. Evaluate methods or software to assess relevance to a problem. Compare similar options to determine which are more appropriate for a given application (Goals: 1, 3)\n\nD. Test and debug software, using the following sequence: (Goals: 3, 4)\n\n   1. Reproduce the error in a new environment,\n  \n   2. Create a minimal reproducible example,\n  \n   3. Research the error message and evaluate online resources for relevance,\n   \n   4. Ask for help, describing the error or problem appropriately.\n\nE. Document the data, methods, and results of an analysis using reproducible methods. (Goals: 1, 2, 4)\n\n\n## How to Use This Book {-}\n\nI've made an effort to use some specific formatting and enable certain features that make this book a useful tool for this class.\n\n### Header Buttons/Links {-}\n\nThe header contains a number of buttons which should help you use, customize, and navigate the textbook\n\n- <i class=\"fa fa-align-justify\"></i> Open/close the sidebar TOC\n- <i class=\"fa fa-search\"></i> Search the text\n- <i class=\"fa fa-font\"></i> Set font size and white/sepia/dark mode\n- <i class=\"fa fa-edit\"></i> Suggest edits if you find a typo. This will help you automatically submit a pull request in Github, and I can review and approve it easily.\n- <i class=\"fa fa-download\"></i> Download the entire (very long) Rmarkdown source code for the textbook\n- <i class=\"fa fa-info\"></i> See keyboard shortcuts to navigate the book\n- <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i> Reference the book in a tweet, if you really want to. Tag me if you do (\\@srvanderplas)\n- <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i> Find the book repository on GitHub quickly if you want to see code/data/etc. linked in the book\n\n\n### Special Sections {-}\n\n\n::: watchout\n\n#### Watch Out {-}\n\nWatch out sections contain things you may want to look out for - common errors, etc.\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: ex\n\n#### Examples {-}\n\nExample sections contain code and other information. Don't skip them!\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: my-opinion\n\n#### My Opinion {-}\n\nThese sections contain things you should definitely not consider as fact and should just take with a grain of salt. \n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: go-read\n\n#### Go Read {-}\n\nSometimes, there are better resources out there than something I could write myself. When you see this section, go read the enclosed link as if it were part of the book.\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: tryitout\n\n#### Try it out {-}\n\nTry it out sections contain activities you should do to reinforce the things you've just read. You will be much more successful in this class if you do the try it out sections before you come to class.\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: learn-more\n\n#### Learn More {-}\n\nLearn More sections contain other references that may be useful on a specific topic. Suggestions are welcome (use the edit link at the top to suggest a new reference that I should add), as there's no way for one person to catalog all of the helpful statistical programming resources on the internet!\n\n:::\n\n&nbsp;\n\n::: note\n\n#### Note {-}\n\nNote sections contain clarification points (anywhere I would normally say \"note that ....) \n\n:::\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Expandable Sections {-}\n\n<details><summary>These are expandable sections, with additional information when you click on the line</summary>\n\nThis additional information may be information that is helpful but not essential, or it may be that an example just takes a LOT of space and I want to make sure you can skim the book without having to scroll through a ton of output.\n</details>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<details class=\"ex\"><summary>Many times, examples will be in expandable sections</summary>\nThis keeps the code and output from obscuring the actual information in the textbook that I want you to retain. You can always look up the syntax, but you do need to absorb the details I've written out.\n</details>\n\n\n",
