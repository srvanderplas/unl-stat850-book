# Principles of Debugging {#debugging}

## Module Objectives {-}

- Break down a complex procedure into simpler steps, mapping each step to a separate function which performs a single task.
- Simplify a problem to the minimal components necessary to reproduce the error, and use that information to ask for help appropriately.
- Use built-in debugging tools to trace an error to its source
- Use online forums and mailing lists to research error messages

Note: The skills in this chapter take a lifetime to truly master. The real goal here is that you know how to ask for help appropriately (and in a way that people will respond positively to) and that you know how to do the research to get help yourself.
