## Tools for Statistical Computing

The goal of this class is to expose you to basic computing skills in R and Python.

First, lets cover the basics of setting up the software you're going to be using in this course. You don't at this point have to understand what the different software DOES, but you should at least get it installed and working -- this may be tricky, so we'll take it slow.

### Programming Languages

You *must* install R for this class, and if you have any interest in learning Python you should probably go ahead and install that as well.

#### R {#setting-up-R}

R is an open-source statistical programming language. It is a domain-specific language -- that is, it is optimized for doing statistics, and is NOT a general-purpose programming language like C or python.  This means that R is very good for doing data-related tasks, but if you want to implement something that is not data related (or even not tabular data related), it may be harder than you expect.

<!-- Differences between R and RStudio -->
<details>
<summary> A short "history of R" </summary>
R is a statistical computing language which originated as an open-source clone of Bell labs S computing language. S was inspired by Scheme, but also has features which are similar to Lisp. It is a scripting language (you don't have to compile the code before it runs) and is natively accessed using a command-line prompt. One feature of R that is relatively unique is that it uses vector-based math, which means that mathematical operations on vectors occur for the entire vector without having to use loops to iterate through the vector line-by-line (this feature is more common in languages designed for data manipulation, like Matlab and Julia; it is rare in more general-purpose computing languages). R is optimized for working on data: unlike more general programming languages such as Python, R was built with the idea of facilitating data analysis. As a result, data structures in R tend to be more natural for statistical work than similar structures in Python or C, which can feel unwieldy. From a computer science perspective, though, R seems like an extremely odd language because the design choices that make data analysis easier are unconventional for more general-purpose languages.
</details>

For the most part, in this class, we will use R within RStudio.


##### Installation {#installing-R}

1. Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (4.0 or higher). 

2. If you are on Windows, please also install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Match your version of R to the correct version of Rtools.

<details><summary>Tutorial videos and additional help</summary>

Note that the tutorial videos use versions of R that are *old*. You should be installing at least R 4.0 (if you have an older version, please update.) The basic installation process is the same, though, so the videos are still useful.

- <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> [R on Mac installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icawuhf0Yqo)

- <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> R on Linux installation    
On Linux, instead of a YouTube video, you get a text-based  [tutorial](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl/wiki/Installing-swirl-on-Linux). One of the Debian maintainers, Dirk Eddelbuettel, is also on R core, which means that R tends to work extremely well with Debian-based distributions, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint. R does work on RPM based distros, and you can of course also compile it from source for Arch/Gentoo, but I've stuck with Deb-based distributions for approximately 7 years because it seems to be a bit less hassle. Additional troubleshooting can be found [here](https://pages.github.nceas.ucsb.edu/NCEAS/help/installing_r_on_ubuntu.html).

</details>

Once you have R installed, try to run the following code, which will install (most of) the packages you need to run the code in this book. 

```{r install-req-pkgs, eval = F}
# Read in a list of all packages that are required
pkgs <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/data/packages")

# Remove packages only available on github
pkgs <- setdiff(pkgs, c("nycsquirrels18", "emo", "tweetrmd", "classdata"))

# Remove any already installed packages from the list
pkgs <- setdiff(pkgs, installed.packages())

# The following code will not make a lot of sense... yet. Come back to it in a 
# few weeks and see how much you understand (or can decode)

# This ensures that if the installation fails, the code will keep running
try_install_pkg <- function(...) try(install.packages(..., dependencies = T))
lapply(pkgs, try_install_pkg)
pkgs <- setdiff(pkgs, installed.packages())

if (length(pkgs) > 0) {
  paste("The following packages did not install: \n", paste(pkgs, collapse = "\n"))
}

# Try installing github packages
devtools::install_github(c("mine-cetinkaya-rundel/nycsquirrels18", 
                           "hadley/emo", 
                           "gadenbuie/tweetrmd", 
                           "heike/classdata"))
```

If some packages did not install, feel free to post in Yellowdig with the error message(s) received and the list of packages you're having trouble installing (or contact me and we'll set up a time to debug). 



#### Python {#setting-up-python}

1. Install Python 3 on your machine: [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install Jupyter on your machine using [these instructions](https://jupyter.org/install) (install with pip unless you know what you're doing)


### Development Environment: RStudio {#setting-up-rstudio}

We will be using RStudio as the primary development environment in this class. That means you will be writing code in RStudio, interacting with git through RStudio, and more. You can write Python code in RStudio as well, so if you want to use Python along with R, this class is set up to allow you to do that easily.

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Basically, it adds a pretty graphical layer on top of R, providing an easy way to develop R code, evaluate that code, and keep track of all of the variables which are available in the computing environment. RStudio contains integrations which provide syntax highlighting, code folding, basic checks (missing parentheses, etc.), debugging tools, and many other features. RStudio was designed around the idea of making R easier to use and making it easy to develop statistical software reproducibly. RStudio (the company) is responsible for adding many features to the R ecosystem which facilitate running statistical analyses and presenting the results in user-friendly ways.

RStudio is not R - it's just a layer on top of R. So if you have a question about the user interface, you have an RStudio question. If you have a question about the code, you have an R question.

#### Installation {#installing-rstudio}

You can find RStudio [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You want the open source edition of RStudio Desktop. If you're feeling brave, you can install the [preview release](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/#download) - this may have a few bugs, but tends to be relatively stable and has the latest features. Please install RStudio 2022.02.2 or higher for this class. 

If you're on Linux, go ahead and [import RStudio's public key](https://rstudio.com/code-signing/) so that software validation works. (All of the commands are provided in the linked page)

#### Navigating RStudio

![The RStudio window will look something like this.](images/tools/Rstudio_env.png)

- In the top-left pane is the text editor. This is where you'll do most of your work.

- In the top right, you'll find the environment, history, and connections tabs. The environment tab shows you the objects available in R (variables, data files, etc.), the history tab shows you what code you've run recently, and the connections tab is useful for setting up database connections.

- On the bottom left is the console. There are also other tabs to give you a terminal (command line) prompt, and a jobs tab to monitor progress of long-running jobs. In this class we'll primarily use the console tab. 

- On the bottom right, there are a set of tabs: 
  - files (to give you an idea of where you are working, and what files are present), 
  - plots (which will be self-explanatory), 
  - packages (which extensions to R are installed and loaded), 
  - the help window (where documentation will show up), and 
  - the viewer window, which is used for interactive graphics or previewing HTML documents. 

#### Try It Out {- .tryitout}

To get started, type 2+2 into the console window and hit enter.

Now, type 2+2 into the text editor and press the run button that is on the pane's shortcut bar (or, you can hit Ctrl-Enter/CMD-Enter to send a single line to the console). 

If both of those things worked, you're probably set up correctly!

Next, try typing this into the text editor, then run the line. Look in the environment tab and see if you can see what has changed.

```{r env-var-changes}
a <- 3 # store 3 in the variable a
```

![Your environment window should now look something like this (the .Last.value entry may not be there, and that's ok)](images/tools/Rstudio_env_var.png)

You can use the environment window to preview your data, check on the status of variables, and more. Note that while R is running, the window doesn't update (so you can't check on the status of a loop while the loop is running using the window).

### Version Control 

::: note
Most of this section is either heavily inspired by @bryanHappyGitGitHub2021 or directly links to that book. 
:::

We will be using git to track changes made to code in this class. As a bonus, this will also allow you to submit your homework via github, collaborate with group members easily, and I can even help you with your assignments and see what the problem(s) is (are) ... as long as you keep your homework repository up to date!

Git is a version control system - the goal of git and other version control systems is to help groups of programmers work on large projects together. Git manages a collection of files in a structured way - rather like "track changes" in Microsoft Word or versioning in Dropbox, but much more powerful.

<img alt="You don't want to end up here. Version control is the answer to this problem." src="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif" width = "50%"/>

In data science programming, we use git for a similar, but slightly different purpose. We use it to keep track of changes not only to code files, but to data files, figures, reports, and other essential bits of information. 

If you are working alone, you will benefit from adopting version control because it will remove the need to add _final.R to the end of your file names. However, most of us work in collaboration with other people (or will have to work with others eventually), so one of the goals of Stat 850 is to teach you how to use git because it is a useful tool that will make you a better collaborator. 

Git itself is nice enough, but where git really becomes amazing is when you combine it with GitHub - an online service that makes it easy to use git across many computers, share information with collaborators, publish to the web, and more. Git is great, but GitHub is ... essential. In this class, we'll be using both git and github, and your homework will be managed with GitHub Classroom. 

#### Installing Git {#setting-up-git}

To install git, see the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). 

Write down, or keep track of, the git installation path on your machine. This will make your life much easier.

There is a [troubleshooting guide](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) that has some common problems which occur during git installation.

#### Getting Started with Git

![If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)


Git is a program whose primary purpose is **version control**. Git tracks changes to each file that it is told to monitor, and as the files change, you provide short labels describing what the changes were and why they exist (called "commits"). The log of these changes (along with the file history) is called your git commit history. 

When writing papers, this means you can cut material out freely, so long as the paper is being tracked by git - you can always go back and get that paragraph you cut out if you need to. You also don't have to rename files - you can confidently overwrite your files, so long as you remember to commit frequently. 

::: go-read
The git material in this chapter is just going to link directly to the book "Happy Git with R" by Jenny Bryan. It's amazing, amusing, and generally well written. I'm not going to try to do better. 

[Go read Chapter 1, if you haven't already.](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)
:::


#### GitHub: Git on the Web {#setting-up-github}

See the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html) to set up a GitHub account.

<details><summary>Git and Github: Slightly crude (but memorable) analogy</summary>
Git is to GitHub what Porn is to PornHub. Specifically, GitHub hosts git repositories publicly, while PornHub hosts porn publicly. But it would be silly to equate porn and PornHub, and it's similarly silly to think of GitHub as the only place you can use git repositories.
</details>

Git is a program that runs on your machine and keeps track of changes to files that you tell it to monitor. GitHub is a website that hosts people's git repositories. You can use git without GitHub, but you can't use GitHub without git. 

If you want, you can hook Git up to GitHub, and make a copy of your local git repository that lives in the cloud. Then, if you configure things correctly, your local repository will talk to GitHub without too much trouble. Using Github with Git allows you to **easily make a cloud backup of your important code**, so that even if your  computer suddenly catches on fire, all of your important code files exist somewhere else. 

Remember: any data you don't have in 3 different places is data you don't care about.^[Yes, I'm aware that this sounds paranoid. It's been a very rare occasion that I've needed to restore something from another backup. You don't want to take chances. I knew a guy who had to retype his entire masters thesis from the printed out version the night before it was due because he had stored it on a network drive that was decommissioned. You don't want to be that person.]


#### Introduce yourself to git and set up SSH authentication

You need to tell git what your name and email address are, because every "commit" you make will be signed. 

Follow the instructions [here](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html), or run the lines below:

```{r, collapse = T, results = "hold", eval = F}

user_name <- readline(prompt = "Your full name: ")
user_email <- readline(prompt = "The address associated w your github account: ")

install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

use_git_config(user.name = user_name, user.email = user_email, scope = "user")

# Tell git to ignore all files that are OS-dependent and don't have useful data.
git_vaccinate() 

# Create a ssh key if one doesn't already exist
if (!file.exists(git2r::ssh_path("id_rsa.pub"))) {
  system("ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096") # Create an ssh key
  system("eval $(ssh-agent -s)")
  system("ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa")
} 
```

Then, in RStudio, go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN. View your public key, and copy it to the clipboard. 

Then, proceed to github. Make sure you're signed into GitHub. Click on your profile pic in upper right corner and go Settings, then SSH and GPG keys. Click "New SSH key". Paste your public key in the "Key" box. Give it an informative title. For example, you might use 2022-laptop to record the year and computer. Click "Add SSH key".

#### Optional: Install a git client

[Instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html)

I don't personally use a git client other than RStudio, but you may prefer to have a client that allows you to use a point-and-click interface. It's up to you. 

### Document Creation {#setting-up-tex}

In this class, you'll be learning to create documents that integrate code, results, and commentary. We'll use a variety of different methods to do this, because it's a critical part of working as a statistician. For now, just install these packages and don't worry too much about the rest. 

Install the Quarto CLI tool using [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Select RStudio as your tool.    
You will read the tutorial on how to use Quarto in Perusall, so it's ok to skip that right now.

We'll be installing LaTeX and Pandoc using R packages `tinytex` and `rmarkdown`. 

Launch R, and type the following commands into the console:

```{r tinytex-install, eval = F}
install.packages(c("tinytex", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "quarto"))
library(tinytex)
install_tinytex()
```

If you run into any errors, email me or post on YellowDig for help.

#### LaTeX


LaTeX is a typesetting program, which makes it different from most other document creation software, such as MS Word, which is "WYSIWYG" - what you see is what you get. In LaTeX, you'll type in code to create a document, and LaTeX will compile the document into something pretty. The goal is that you have to think less about formatting and what goes on which page - LaTeX will handle that part for you - so that you can think more about the content.

<details><summary>Why use LaTeX?</summary>
<img src="images/tools/02_word_formatting.png" alt="using microsoft word: moves an image one mm to the left. all text and images shift. four new pages appear. paragraph breaks form a union. a swarm of commas buzzes at the window. In the distance, sirens." width="50%"/>

(shamelessly stolen from FB, which apparently stole it from Tumblr)

Latex is meant for you to focus on the content and not worry about the formatting - the computer optimizes figure placement according to directives you've given. 
</details>

In practice, it doesn't usually work out like that, so there are programs like markdown which aim to simplify document creation even more to free you from the formatting that LaTeX requires. 

LaTeX[@knuth84] is often used for typesetting statistical and mathematical papers because its equation editor is top notch. (It was actually written by Donald Knuth because he got so annoyed trying to write his dissertation that he took some time off to write TeX first, and then used it to write his dissertation).^[Amusingly, `knitr` [@knitr] was written in much the same manner. Yihui Xie had to substitute-teach ISU's version of 850 on the day we covered Sweave (a predecessor to knitr). He got so frustrated teaching the class that he went home and started writing `knitr`. Later, he developed Rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, and several other packages aimed at making writing documents + code easier to handle.    
Moral of the story - if you get frustrated with the tools you have, you're in good company. Use it as fuel to make better tools.] 

::: try-it-out

If you want to try to make a simple LaTeX document in RStudio, [try out this LaTeX tutorial](https://latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/first-document/).

:::

#### Markdown

We'll work with LaTeX later in the semester, but for now, we'll be primarily working with Quarto or Rmarkdown, which is much simpler. [Here's a quick cheatsheet](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html). 

When you use markdown within RStudio, you don't have to worry about where pandoc lives on your computer (e.g. the path). You can just click the button at the top of the file that says "Knit" or "Preview" to see what your file looks like.

If you want to try out some simple Markdown formatting, you can create a new Rmarkdown document by going to File > New File > Rmarkdown (or Quarto Markdown) and testing out the simple document it starts you out with.

[This cheat sheet is a very useful guide to Rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)


## Some Computer Basics

I grew up in the 1990s, and to use computers, you had to know a bit more about how computers worked than you do now. We also weren't so far away from the days of file cabinets with actual file folders. 

Many people teaching computing in the 2020s have noticed that students are lacking some essential awareness of some of the basics of how a computer works... essentials that help out a lot when it comes time to program a computer. So this section is intended to serve as a quick overview of some of those  principles. Scan it, and if you don't understand what a term means, please do some googling.

### File Systems

File systems control how data is stored and accessed on your computer. You might be familiar with acronyms like NTFS, FAT32, etc. - basically, these systems help make sense of the storage on your computer, tracking where files start and end, how much space is left, directory structures, and so on.

For this class, it will probably be important to distinguish between local file storage (your C:/ drive on <i class="fab fa-windows"></i>, /user/your-name/ on <i class="fab fa-apple"></i>, or /home/your-name/ on <i class="fab fa-linux"></i>) and network/virtual file systems, such as OneDrive and iCloud. 

You want to save your files in this class to your **physical hard drive**. This will save you a lot of troubleshooting time.


### System Paths

When you install software, it is saved in a specific location on your computer, like C:/Program Files/ on <i class="fab fa-windows"></i>, /Applications/ on <i class="fab fa-apple"></i>, or /usr/local/bin/ on <i class="fab fa-linux"></i>. For the most part, you don't need to keep track of where programs are installed, because the install process (usually) automatically creates icons on your desktop or in your start menu, and you find your programs there.

Unfortunately, that isn't sufficient when you're programming, because you may need to know where a program is in order to reference that program -- for instance, if you need to pop open a browser window as part of your program, you're going to have to tell your computer where that browser executable file lives.

To simplify this process, operating systems have what's known as a "system path" or "user path" - a list of folders containing important places to look for executable and other important files. You may, at some point, have to edit your system path to add a new folder to it, making the executable files within that folder more easily available. [This](https://superuser.com/a/284361/391106) explanation of how to set system paths may be useful if it comes up; an additional (slightly different) explanation [here](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7) may also help. Additional examples are available [<i class="fab fa-windows"></i> here](https://miktex.org/howto/modify-path), [<i class="fab fa-apple"></i> here](https://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/), and [<i class="fab fa-linux"></i> here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/). 

If you run across an error that says something along the lines of 

- could not locate xxx.exe
- The system cannot find the path specified
- Command Not Found

you might start thinking about whether your system path is set correctly for what you're trying to do. 

If you want to locate where an executable is found (in this example, we'll use `git`), you can run `where git` on windows, or `which git` on OSX/Linux.

Some programs, like RStudio, have places where you can set the locations of common dependencies. If you go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN, you can set the path to git. 

### Working Directories

When you launch a program, that program starts up with a specific directory as its "location" - the place where it will look for files. Most of the time, we don't think too much about this when using graphical programs, but it's much more important to get this right when programming things ourselves.

In RStudio, you can set your working directory in several ways:

1. Work in an RStudio Project (File > New Project), which will make it easy to access your project folder, and will set your working directory to the right folder automatically. I've created a project in `/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/test-project`    
![Setup window for RStudio projects](images/tools/test-project-setup.png)

2. Use `setwd()` to set your working directory. If I'm not working in the RStudio project described above, I can set my working directory to that folder using:
`setwd("/home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/test-project")`

3. Use the files tab (bottom right) to navigate to your preferred folder. Then, click More > Set As Working Directory.


In this class, we're going to focus on reproducibility - making sure your code runs on any other computer with the right project setup. So with that in mind:

1. Work in projects
2. Store your data in your project folder
3. Use local paths - if you're in your project folder and trying to reference "data.xls", then you would just use "data.xls" as the path. If your data is in a "code" folder, you would use "code/data.xls" as the path.

This will ensure that your code should work on any other machine, as long as your data is in your git repository and your code uses local file paths.

## Using Version Control (with RStudio)


The first skill you need to actually practice in this class is using version control. Your homework this week will not require you to program, but you will have to write a nice markdown document and add it to your github repository. 

By using version control from the very beginning, you will learn better habits for programming, but you'll also get access to a platform for collaboration, hosting your work online, keeping track of features and necessary changes, and more. 

I will be using github classroom to run this class. When you go to do your homework assignment, you'll have to complete the following steps: 

1. Clone the template repository for the assignment.
2. Read the assignment instructions in the template repository. Complete the assignment, ensuring that you write fully reproducible code that can be run on any machine.
3. Commit your changes to the assignment to the local git repository on your computer
4. Push your changes from your local machine to GitHub
5. Submit a link to the GitHub repository so that I can grade your assignment.

GitHub Classroom is FERPA compliant, which means that your repositories from this class won't show up under your user (because class enrollment is protected information). 

This workflow means that if you push your changes to GitHub but something isn't working, I can easily see what you've done so far and help you fix any errors that show up. You don't have to email me with a vague error message and then respond to my confused emails 10x as we narrow in on the problem - I can usually just find the problem in your file directly. This saves a lot of time!


So, what does your typical git/GitHub workflow look like? I'll go through this in (roughly) chronological order. This is primarily my higher-level understanding of git - I do not have any idea how it works on the backend, but I'm pretty comfortable with the clone/push/pull/commit/add workflows, and I've used a few of the more complicated features (branches, pull requests) on occasion. 

### Create a Repository

**Repositories** are single-project containers. You may have code, documentation, data, TODO lists, and more associated with a project. If you combine a git repository with an RStudio project, you get a very powerful combination that will make your life much easier... but you of course do not have to do that if you are ok with making things hard for yourself.

To create a repository, you can start with your local computer first, or you can start with the online repository first. 

::: .watch-out
Both methods are relatively simple, but the options you choose depend on which method you're using, so be careful not to get them confused. 
:::

#### Local repository first

Let's suppose you already have a folder on your machine named `hello-world-1` (you may want to create this folder now). You've created a starter document, say, a text file named README with "hello world" written in it. 

If you want, you can use the following R code to set this up:

```{r git-local-repository-first, eval = F}
dir <- "./hello-world-1"
if (!dir.exists(dir)) {
  dir.create(dir)
}
file <- file.path(dir, "README")
if (!file.exists(file)) {
  writeLines("hello world", con = file)
}
```

To create a local git repository, we can go to the terminal (in Mac/Linux) or the git bash shell (in Windows), navigate to our repository folder (not shown, will be different on each computer), and type in 

```
git init
```

Alternately, if you prefer a GUI (graphical user interface) approach, that will work too:

1. Open Rstudio
2. Project (upper right corner) -> New Project -> Existing Directory. Navigate to the directory.
3. (In your new project) Tools -> Project options -> Git/SVN -> select git from the dropdown, initialize new repository. RStudio will  need to restart.
4. Navigate to your new Git tab on the top right.

The next step is to add our file to the repository. 

Using the command line, you can type in `git add README` (this tells git to track the file) and then commit your changes (enter them into the record) using `git commit -m "Add readme file"`.

Using the GUI, you navigate to the git pane, check the box next to the README file, click the Commit button, write a message ("Add readme file"), and click the commit button.

The final step is to create a corresponding repository on GitHub. Navigate to your GitHub profile and make sure you're logged in. Create a new repository using the "New" button. Name your  repository whatever you want, fill in the description if you want (this can help you later, if you forget what exactly a certain repo was *for*), and DO NOT add a README, license file, or anything else (if you do, you will have a bad  time). 

You'll be taken to your empty repository, and git will provide you the lines to paste into your git shell (or terminal) -- you can access this within RStudio, as shown below. Paste those lines in, and you'll be good to  go.

####  GitHub repository first

In the GitHub-first method, you'll create a repository in GitHub and then clone it to your local machine (clone = create an exact copy locally). 

GUI method:

1. Log into GitHub and create a new repository
2. Initialize your repository with a README
3. Copy the repository location by clicking on the "Code" button on the repo homepage
4. Open RStudio -> Project -> New Project -> From version control. Paste your repository URL into the box. Hit enter.
5. Make a change to the README file
6. Click commit, then push your changes
7. Check that the remote repository (Github) updated

Command line method:

1. Log into GitHub and create a new repository
2. Initialize your repository with a README
3. Copy the repository location by clicking on the "Code" button on the repo homepage
4. Navigate to the location you want your repository to live on your machine.
5. Clone the repository by using the git shell or terminal: `git clone <your repo url here>`. In my case, this looks like `git clone git@github.com:stat850-unl/hello-world-2.git`
6. Make a change to your README file and save the change
7. Commit your changes: `git commit -a -m "change readme"` (-a = all, that is, any  changed file git is already tracking).
8. Push your changes to the remote (GitHub) repository and check that the repo has updated: `git push`

### Adding files

`git add` tells git that you want it to track a particular file. 

![git add  diagram: add tells git to add the file to the index of files git monitors.](images/tools/git-add.png)

You don't need to understand exactly what git is doing on the backend, but it is important to know that the actual **contents** of the file aren't logged by `git add` - you have to **commit** your changes for the contents to change. `git add` deals solely with the index of files that git "knows about", and what it thinks belongs in each commit. 

If you use the RStudio GUI for your git interface, you generally won't have to do much with git add; it's (sort-of, kind-of) equivalent to clicking the check box.

#### What files should I add to git?

Git is built for tracking text files. It  will (begrudgingly) deal with small binary files (e.g. images, PDFs) without complaining too much, but it is NOT meant for storing large files, and GitHub will not allow you to push anything that has a file larger than 100MB^[Yes, I'm seriously pushing it with this book; several of the datasets are ~30 MB]. Larger files can be handled with git-lfs (large file storage), but storing large files online is not something you can get for free.

In general, you should **only add a file to git if you created it by hand**. If you compiled the result, that should  not be in the git repository under normal conditions (there are exceptions to this rule -- this book is hosted on GitHub, which means I've pushed the compiled book to the GitHub repository). 

You should also be  cautious about adding files like .Rprog, .directory, .DS_Store, etc. These files are used by your operating system or by RStudio, and pushing them may cause problems for your collaborators (if you're collaborating). Tracking changes to  these files also doesn't really do much good.

I **highly** recommend that you make a point to only add and commit files which you consciously want to track. 

### Staging your changes

In RStudio,  when you check a box next to the file name in the git tab, you are effectively adding the file (if it is not already added) AND staging all of the changes you've made to the file. In practice, `git add` will both add and stage all of the changes to any given file, but it is also useful in some cases to stage only certain lines from a file.

More formally, **staging** is saying "I'd like these changes to be added to the current version, I think". Before you **commit** your changes, you have to first **stage** them. You can think of this like going to the grocery store: you have items in your cart, but you can put them back at any point before checkout. Staging changes is like adding items to your cart; committing those changes is like checking out.

Individually staging lines of a file is most useful in situations where you've made changes which should be part of multiple commits. To stage individual lines of a file, you can use `git add -i` at the command line, or you can attempt to use RStudio's "stage selection" interface. Both  will work, though git can't always separate changes quite as finely as you might want (and as a result, RStudio's interface sometimes seems  unresponsive, even though the underlying issue is with what git can do).



### Committing your changes

A git **commit** is the equivalent of a log entry - it tells git to record the state of the file, along with a message about what that state means. On the back end, git will save a copy of the file in its current state to its cache. 

![Here, we commit the red line as a change to our file.](images/tools/git-commit.png)

In general, you want your commit message to be relatively short, but also informative. The best way to do this is to commit **small** blocks of changes. Work to commit  every time you've accomplished a small task. This will do two things: 

1. You'll have small, bite-sized changes that are briefly described  to serve as a record of what you've done (and what still needs doing)
2. When you mess up (or end up in a merge conflict) you will have a much easier time pinpointing the spot where things went bad, what code was there before, and (because you have nice, descriptive commit messages) how the error occurred.

### Pushing and Pulling

When you're working alone, you generally won't need to worry about having to update your local copy of the repository (unless you're using multiple machines). However, statistics  is collaborative, and one of the most powerful parts of git is that you can use it to keep track of changes when multiple people are working on the same document. 

::: .watch-out
If you are working collaboratively and you and your collaborator are working on the same file, git will be able to resolve the change you make SO LONG AS YOU'RE NOT EDITING THE SAME LINE. Git works based on lines of text - it detects when there is a change in any line of a text document.

For this reason, I find it makes my life easier to put each sentence on a separate line, so that I can tweak things with fewer merge conflicts. Merge conflicts aren't a huge deal, but they slow the workflow down, and are best avoided where possible. 
:::

**Pulling** describes the process of updating your local copy of the repository (the copy on your computer) with the files that are "in the cloud" (on GitHub). `git pull` (or using the Pull button in RStudio) will perform this update for you. If you are working with collaborators in real time, it is good practice to pull, commit, and push often, because  this vastly reduces the merge conflict potential (and the scope of any conflicts that do pop up). 

**Pushing** describes the process of updating the copy of the repository on another machine (e.g. on GitHub) so that it has the most recent changes you've made to your machine. 

<img alt="git push copies the version of the project on your computer to GitHub" src="images/tools/git_push_diagram.png" width = "45%"/> <img alt="git pull copies the version of the project on GitHub to your computer" src="images/tools/git_pull_diagram.png" width = "45%"/>

In general, your workflow will be 

1. Clone the project or create a new repository
2. Make some changes
3. Stage the changes with git add
4. Commit the changes with git commit
5. Pull any changes from the remote repository
6. Resolve any merge conflicts
7. Push the changes (and merged files) with git push

If you're working alone, steps 5 and 6 are not likely to be necessary, but it is good practice to just pull before you push anyways.

## Topic Sequencing {- .note}

In several places in this class, you'll have to use material that you haven't been formally taught yet. I will do my absolute best to provide thorough instructions, help you along as much as I can, and generally provide enough support that you can muddle through. But it's going to be hard to teach you everything you need to e.g. analyze some data, before providing you the opportunity to SEE that data using visualization packages. And it's silly to teach you plotting before you know how to read data in. But to teach you how to read data in, you need to be able to take a look at the data, and plots are the best way to do that. To do any of this stuff, you need to know about functions, but it can be easier to figure out how to run a function than to write a function. 

You see my problem.

So instead, what I'm going to do is to leave you lots of comments as to what a piece of code does when I'm using things you haven't been formally shown yet. Then, you can copy/paste/modify those pieces of code, and if they break, you can ask why and we'll dig into it (breaking code is usually a good thing, because it means you're learning how to program). For each chapter, focus on learning how to write code that accomplishes that chapter's objectives. If you understand some of the code you're modifying that covers other topics not in that chapter, so much the better. But it's not an expectation or a requirement.

If you're confused, please post on the class message boards so that those who have seen this material before can help you out.
