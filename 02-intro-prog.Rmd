The only way to learn how to program effectively is to take something that works, break it, and then fix it again. There's plenty of theory and you should definitely learn that, but fundamentally, if you are not regularly breaking code, you're probably not programming. 

## Module Objectives {-}

- Identify variable types, data structures, and common reserved words in R and SAS
- Use control structures (loops and conditionals) effectively
- Use matrix algebra functionality in R and SAS to perform basic calculations

More informally, the goal is to get familiar with the basics of each programming language.


## Definitions {-}

Many programming resources talk about 3, or 5, or 10 core concepts in any programming language. In this module, we're going to discuss the generic concepts, and then how these concepts are implemented in R and SAS.

Interestingly, the "core concepts" aren't necessarily the same across lists. So, here is a consensus list of concepts which are generic across languages and usually important:

1. **Variables** - a symbolic name or reference to some kind of information. In the expression `a + b > a`, both `a` and `b` are variables. Variables may have a specific type (what data can be stored in the variable), scope (where the variable can be accessed), location (in memory). [Here](https://dev.to/lucpattyn/basic-programming-concepts-for-beginners-2o73) is a nice explanation of the difference between variables in programming and variables in math.

2. **Conditional statements** (if statements) - These statements allow the program to handle information adaptively - if a statement is true, one set of instructions will be used, and if the statement is false, a different set of instructions will be used.

3. **Looping and iteration** - An iteration is any time a sequence of steps is executed. Most languages have several different types of loops or iteration: `for` loops, which allow for the sequence of steps to be executed a specific number of times, `while` loops, which allow for the sequence of steps to be executed while a conditional statement is true, `recursion`, where a block of code calls itself.

4. **Data types and data structures** - these concepts determine what information a variable can hold. Data types are lower-level, simple objects (floating-point numbers, integers, boolean T/F, characters, strings). Data structures may include lists (sequences of many objects) and vectors (sequences of many objects of the same type), dictionaries (a list of key-value pairs), objects (data structures which may hold multiple related pieces of information). 

5. **Functions**, or self-contained modules of code that accomplish a particular task. 

6. **Syntax**, the set of rules that define which combinations of symbols consist of correctly structured and interpretable commands in the language.

7. **Tools**, the set of external programs which may help with development and writing code. Some common tools are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), which may correct syntax and typos, organize files for you, allow you to keep track of which variables you have defined, and assist you with code organization and navigation. Other tools include compilers (which take human-written code and translate it into efficient machine code), version control systems (which help you track changes to code over time), debuggers, and documentation generators. Not all of these tools are necessary for all languages - scripting languages such as python and R do not require compilers by default, for instance.  

8. **Sequence of commands**: It's important to have the right commands in the right order. Some recipes, like bread dough, are flexible, and you can add the ingredients in almost any order, but in other recipes, the order matters as much as the correct quantity of ingredients (try putting the cheese powder in before the noodles are boiled when making macaroni and cheese. Yuck.). Programming tends to be like these less flexible recipes.

## Statistical Programming Languages {-}

Having established the generic definitions of the concepts which apply to almost any programming language, we now must examine how R and SAS implement these concepts. R and SAS are both statistical programming languages - they are specifically designed to work with data, which means that they make compromises that other languages do not in order to make it easier to write code where the data (rather than the functions, classes, methods, or objects) are the primary concern.

Both [R](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/history-and-overview-of-r.html) and [SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software)#History) have long histories. SAS in particular dates back to the 1960s, and has syntax which is unique compared to more modern languages such as C, python, Java, and R. R's predecessor, S, dates back to 1976 and was designed for internal use at Bell Labs. The histories of both languages are useful in understanding why they are useful for their respective tasks, but are not essential for this course (so read them at your leisure).

The biggest difference between R and SAS (at a fundamental level) is that R is a [**functional** language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html) - it consists mainly of functions, which can (and do) manipulate objects, including other functions. SAS, on the other hand, is a procedural language - most SAS programs follow a specific series of steps, known as "proc"s. Procs are essentially functions (or compositions of multiple functions), but in SAS, it is simpler to think of an analysis as a series of procedural steps; in R, there are steps, but they may be implemented in a more flexible way (depending on the analysis). Another interesting feature of SAS is that it's really several languages - some commands work in PROC IML (interactive matrix language) but not in a DATA step. When looking for help in SAS, make sure you're referencing the correct part of the language documentation.

#### {- .note}

I kept the classic R reference card by my computer for about 5 years, and referenced it at least once or twice a day for that entire period. There will be other cheat sheets and reference cards scattered through this book because if you can't remember something's name, you might be able to remember where it is on the reference card (or at least, that's how I learned R).

## Variable types

Variable types are sufficiently different in R and SAS that we will cover R first, then SAS. 

### R

In R, there are 4 commonly-used types: 

| Type | Description | 
| ---- | ----------- | 
| character | holds text-based information: "abcd" or "3.24a" are examples of values which would be stored as characters in R| 
| logical | holds binary information: 0/1, or FALSE/TRUE. Logical variables are stored as single bit information (e.g. either a 0 or 1), but display as TRUE and FALSE (which are reserved words and constants). It is possible to use the shorthand `F` and `T`, but be careful with this, because `F` and `T` are not reserved, and other information can be stored within them.| 
| integer | holds (as you might expect) integers. Note that integers are handled differently than doubles (floating point numbers), but in general, R will implicitly convert integers to doubles to avoid common pitfalls with integer divison (which does not allow for decimals). | 
| double | holds floating point numbers. By default, most numeric variables in R are doubles.| 


You can test to see whether a variable holds a value of a specific type using the `is.xxx()` functions, which are demonstrated below. You can convert a variable of one type to another with `as.xxx()` functions. You can test what type a variable is using `typeof()`.

#### {- .note}
Note that `<-` is used for assigning a value to a variable. So the first line in the code below is read "x gets 'R is awesome'" or "x is assigned the value 'R is awesome'". 

#### {-}

#### Demonstration of variable types: {-}

##### Character Variables {-}
<details>
```{r is-fcns-char}
x <- "R is awesome"
typeof(x)
is.character(x)
is.logical(x)
is.integer(x)
is.double(x)
```
</details>

##### Logical Variables  {-}
<details>
```{r is-fcns-lgl}
x <- FALSE
typeof(x)
is.character(x)
is.logical(x)
is.integer(x)
is.double(x)
```
</details>

##### Integer Variables  {-}
<details>
```{r is-fcns-int}
x <- 2
typeof(x)
is.character(x)
is.logical(x)
is.integer(x)
is.double(x)
```

Wait, 2 is an integer, right?

2 is an integer, but in R, values are assumed to be doubles unless specified. So if we want R to treat 2 as an integer, we need to specify that it is an integer specifically. 

```{r is-fcns-int2}
x <- 2L # The L immediately after the 2 indicates that it is an integer.
typeof(x)
is.character(x)
is.logical(x)
is.integer(x)
is.double(x)
is.numeric(x)
```
</details>

##### Double Variables  {-}
<details>
```{r is-fcns-dbl}
x <- 2.45
typeof(x)
is.character(x)
is.logical(x)
is.integer(x)
is.double(x)
is.numeric(x)
```
</details>

##### Numeric Variables {-}
A fifth common "type"^[`numeric` is not really a type, it's a mode. Run `?mode` for more information.], `numeric` is really the union of two types: integer and double, and you may come across it when using `str()` or `mode()`, which are similar to `typeof()` but do not quite do the same thing. The `numeric` category exists because when doing math, we can add an integer and a double, but adding an integer and a string is ... trickier. Testing for numeric variables guarantees that we'll be able to do math with those variables. `is.numeric()` and `as.numeric()` work as you would expect them to work.

The general case of this property of a language is called **implicit type conversion** - that is, R will implicitly (behind the scenes) convert your integer to a double and then add the other double, so that the result is unambiguously a double. 

#### Type Conversions
R will generally work hard to seamlessly convert variables to different types. So, for instance, 
```{r, error = T}
TRUE + 2

2L + 3.1415

"abcd" + 3
```

This conversion doesn't always work - there's no clear way to make "abcd" into a number we could use in addition. So instead, R will issue an error. This error pops up frequently when something went wrong with data import and all of a sudden you just tried to take the mean of a set of string/character variables. Whoops.

When you want to, you can also use `as.xxx()` to make the type conversion **explicit**. So, the analogue of the code above, with explicit conversions would be: 

```{r, error = T}
as.double(TRUE) + 2

as.double(2L) + 3.1415

as.numeric("abcd") + 3
```

When we make our intent explicit (convert "abcd" to a numeric variable) we get an NA - a missing value. There's still no easy way to figure out where "abcd" is on a number line, but our math will still have a result - NA + 3 is NA.

If you are unsure what the type of a variable is, use the `typeof()` function to find out. 

```{r}
w <- "a string"
x <- 3L
y <- 3.1415
z <- FALSE

typeof(w)
typeof(x)
typeof(y)
typeof(z)

```



### SAS

In SAS, there are two basic variable types: numeric and character variables. Thus, SAS does not differentiate between integers and floats or doubles. Functionally, though, the same basic operations can be performed in SAS. As with R, SAS does attempt to implicitly convert variable types, and will notify you that the conversion has taken place in the log file.

SAS will attempt to implicitly convert variables when:

- a character value is assigned to a previously defined numeric variable
- a character value is used in arithmetic operations
- a character value is compared to a numeric value using a comparison operator (<, >, <=, >=)
- a character value is specified in a function that takes numeric arguments

Note that implicit conversion does not occur in WHERE statements. (This will make more sense later, but is here for reference)

If you want to manually convert a value, the INPUT statement can be used. Unlike in R, the INPUT statement has the ability to read numbers which are formatted differently. For instance

```{sashtml sas-ex}
proc printto log="saslog.log" new;
data set1; /* This tells SAS we're defining some variables */
  x = 3;
  y = '3.1415';
  z = x * y; 
  /* this is arithmetic, so y will be converted */
  x = '3.14159'; 
  /* x previously had a number in it, */
  /* so it will be converted to a number here */
  zz = y<=2; 
  /* comparison operator: y will be converted */
  
  put z; /* This prints the result to the log */
  put x=;
  put zz=;
run;
```

Notice that in SAS, `zz`, which is the result of the logical statement `y<=2`, is a numeric variable. The value 0 signifies that the comparison was false. SAS does not have a logical data type, it uses the numeric variable with 0:=FALSE, 1:=TRUE.

```{r readlog-sas-ex, echo = F}
cat(readLines("saslog.log"), sep="\n")

# Do not forget to remove the log file when you are done!
unlink("saslog.log")
```


### Try it out: Variable types {- .tryitout}

#### In R {-}

1. Create variables `string`, `integer`, `decimal`, and `logical`, with types that match the relevant variable names.

```{r, eval = F}
string <- 
integer <- 
decimal <- 
logical <- 
```

2. Can you get rid of the error that occurs when this chunk is run?
```{r try-it-out-arithmetic, eval = F}
logical + decimal
integer + decimal
string + integer
```

3. What happens when you add string to string? logical to logical?

#### In SAS {-}

1. Create variables `string1` and `string2` that each have text/character values. "Bob" and "Jane" might be good options. How does logical operation work with actual character values?

2. What happens if you use `string1` and add 3 to it? 


#### Answers {-}

<details>

```{r try-it-out-data-type-answers, error = T}
string <- "hi, I'm a string"
integer <- 4L
decimal <- 5.412
logical <- TRUE

logical + decimal
integer + decimal
as.numeric(string) + integer

"abcd" + "defg"
TRUE + TRUE
```

In R, adding a string to a string creates an error ("non-numeric argument to binary operator"). Adding a logical to a logical, e.g. TRUE + TRUE, results in `r TRUE + TRUE`, which is a numeric value.

```{sashtml try-it-out-data-type-answers-sas}

proc printto log="saslog.log" new;
data set1; 
  string1 = 'Bob';
  string2 = 'Jane';
  x = string1 < string2;
  put x=; /* This prints the result to the log */
run;

```

```{r readlog-sas-ex-answers, echo = F}
cat(readLines("saslog.log"), sep="\n")

# Do not forget to remove the log file when you are done!
unlink("saslog.log")
```

SAS will actually compare strings based on the first letter: Bob comes before Jane, so Bob < Jane. 


```{sashtml try-it-out-data-type-answers-sas2}
proc printto log="saslog.log" new;

data set2;
  string1 = 'Bob';
  y = string1 + 3;
  put y=;
run;
```

```{r readlog-sas-ex-answers2, echo = F}
cat(readLines("saslog.log"), sep="\n")

# Do not forget to remove the log file when you are done!
unlink("saslog.log")
```

</details>

## Data structures

Data **structures** are more complex arrangements of information than single variables. Of primary interest in statistical programming are the following types of structures:

&nbsp;  | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous
-- | :---------- | :------------
1d | vector | list
2d | matrix | data frame (R) or data set (SAS)
nd | array (R) |

In the table above, homogeneous means that all entries in the structure must be of the same type. Heterogeneous means that the entries are allowed to be of different types. 

#### {- .note}
Figuring out what to call these types with two languages is hard - in SAS, an array is a group of columns of a data set, but in R, it's a multi-dimensional matrix. In this section, we'll discuss the generic concepts relevant to both languages. The differences between the two languages will be discussed as appropriate. As there are more similarities than differences, it's easier to do this in a single section rather than duplicating half of the content.

#### {-}

### Homogeneous data structures (R and SAS)

R does not have scalar types - even single-value variables are technically vectors of length 1. SAS does have scalar types.

If we try to create a heterogeneous vector in R, using the `concatenate` function, `c()`, which combines scalar entries into a vector, what happens?

```{r data-structures-homogeneous}
c(1, 2, "a", "b", "c")
```
Because there were 3 character entries, the entire vector is now a character vector.

#### Watch Out {- .watchout}
This behavior can cause some errors - for instance, R does not read in numeric data formatted with commas as numeric data. You may thus get the result

```{r data-structures-homogeneous2, error = T}
x <- c(356, 452, "1,325")
mean(x)
```

If you are reading in data from a file, this will cause some issues - the whole column of data will be formatted as characters. Keep an eye out for errors of this type. 

#### {-}

#### Indexing

The 1, 2, and multi-dimensional homogeneous data types should be familiar from e.g. linear algebra and calculus. Single elements of a vector can be extracted using single square brackets, e.g. `x[1]` will get the first element of the vector `x`. In a matrix, elements are indexed as row, column, so to get the (2, 2) entry of a matrix x, you would use `x[2,2]`. This is extended for multi-dimensional arrays in R, with each dimension added, e.g. `x[3,1,2]` or `x[4, 3, 2, 1]`. 

To get a full row or column from a matrix (in both SAS and R) you would use `x[1,]` (get the first row) or `x[,3]` (get the 3rd column). 

To select multiple rows or columns from a matrix, you would use `x[, c(1, 3)]` in R or `x[,{1 3}]` in SAS - both options get the first and third column of the matrix, with all rows of data included.

In both R and SAS, `a:b` where a and b are numbers will form a sequence from `a` to `b` by 1s. So `1:4` is `r 1:4`. This is often used to get a set of rows or columns: `x[3:4, 1:2]`.

```{r matrix-example}
x <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5, byrow = T) 
# Create a matrix with values 1 to 20, 5 rows, and fill by row

x

x[3:4, 1:2]
# Gets a submatrix 
```

In SAS, the same basic code works (though matrix definition is a bit more manual). 

```{sas matrix-example-sas}
proc iml; /* Interactive Matrix Language */
  x = {1 2 3 4 5, 6 7 8 9 10, 11 12 13 14 15, 16 17 18 19 20};
  y = x[3:4, 1:2];
  print x; /* Here, print is used instead of put */
  print y;
quit; /* exit proc IML */
```


Both R and SAS are 1-indexed languages, so the elements of a list or vector are indexed as 1, 2, 3, 4, ...  ^[Most languages are 0-indexed languages: C, C++, python, Java, javascript. Vectors in these languages are indexed as 0, 1, 2, 3.  Other 1-indexed languages include FORTRAN, Matlab, Julia, Mathematica, and Lua, many of which were intended for mathematical processing or data analysis.]

As R has logical vectors, it is possible to index a vector using a logical vector of the same length.

#### Try it out {- .tryitout}

```{r vectorindexing, exercise = TRUE}
# From project Euler

# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
#    we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


# Hint: The modulo operator, `%%`, gives the integer remainder of one number 
#       divided by another. So `a %% b` gives the integer remainder when 
#       dividing `a` by `b`. Modular division is often used to find multiples 
#       of a number. 
```

In R: 
```{r vectorindexing-solution}

x <- 1:999 # all nums below 1000

m3 <- (x %% 3) == 0 # multiple of 3
m5 <- (x %% 5) == 0 # multiple of 5
m3or5 <- m3 | m5

proc summary data=tmp; /* Summarize data */
  where (mod(x, 3) = 0) | (mod(x, 5) = 0); 
  /* Keep only obs where x is divisible by 3 or 5 */

  output out=sum_x sum=; /* output sum_x to a new dataset */
run;

proc print data = sum_x; /* print our sum_x dataset */
run;
```

### Heterogeneous data structures

The heterogeneous data types are not much harder to grasp, as they're mostly different ways to combine various homogeneous data types.

#### Lists (R only) {-}

A **list** is, well, a list - a sequence of potentially different-typed values. Unlike when concatenating values, the `list()` command in R allows each value to keep its natural type. You can access elements of a list using `[]` (this will extract a subset of the list items) or `[[]]`, which will extract a single item from the list.

```{r list-index-demo, error = T}
x <- list("a", "b", "c", 1, 2, 3)

x
x[[3]]

x[[4]] + x[[5]]

x[1:2] # This will work

x[[1:2]] # This won't work
```

Some lists consist of named variables. These list components can be accessed either by index (as above) or by name, using the `$` operator. Names which have spaces or special characters must be enclosed in backticks (next to the 1 on the keyboard). Named components can also be accessed using the `[[ ]]` operator.
```{r list-name-demo, error = T}
dog <- list(name = "Edison Vanderplas", age = 8, 
            breed = "Jack Russell Terrorist", 
            `favorite toy` = "a blue and orange stuffed duck. Or rawhide.",
            `link(video)` = "https://youtu.be/zVeoQTOTIuQ")

dog

dog$name
dog$breed
dog$`favorite toy`
dog[["link(video)"]]
```

Most complicated structures in R are lists. You should be able to access any of the pieces of a list using a combination of named references and indexing. 

You can get a sense of the structure of a list (or any other object) in R using the `str()` command. 

```{r list-name-str}

str(dog)

```

Lists can also contain other lists. When accessing a list-within-a-list, just add another index or name reference (see below). 

```{r}
grocery_list <- list(
  dairy = list("asiago", "fontina", "mozzarella", "blue cheese"),
  baking = list("flour", "yeast", "salt"),
  canned_goods = list("pepperoni", "pizza sauce", "olives"),
  meat = list("bacon", "sausage", "anchovies"),
  veggies = list("bell pepper", "onion", "scallions", "tomatoes", "basil")
)

ick <- c(grocery_list[[4]][2:3], grocery_list$canned_goods[[3]])
ick

crust_ingredients <- c(grocery_list$baking, "water")
crust_ingredients

essential_toppings <- c(grocery_list$dairy[3], grocery_list$canned_goods[2])
essential_toppings

yummy_toppings <- c(grocery_list$dairy[c(1, 2, 4)], grocery_list$meat[1], grocery_list[[5]][c(3, 5)])
yummy_toppings
```

##### Try it out {- .tryitout}

Using the list of pizza toppings above as a starting point, make your own list of pizza toppings organized by grocery store section (approximately). Create your own vectors of yummy, essential, and ick toppings.


#### Data frames (R only) {-}

A data frame is a special type of list - one in which each element in the list is a vector of the same length. If you put these vectors side-by-side, you get a table of data that looks like a spreadsheet. When you examine the structure of a data frame, as shown below, you get each column shown in a row, with its type and  the first few values in the column. The `head()` command shows the first 6 rows of a data frame (enough to see what's there, not enough to overflow your screen).

```{r dataframes}
head(mtcars) ## A data frame included in base R

str(mtcars)

```

You can change column values or add new columns easily using assignment. It's also easy to access specific columns to perform summary operations.


Often, it is useful to know the dimensions of a data frame. The number of rows can be obtained by using `nrow(df)` and similarly, the columns can be obtained using `ncol(df)` (or, get both with `dim()`). There is also an easy way to get a summary of each column in the data frame, using `summary()`.


```{r}
mtcars$gpm <- 1/mtcars$mpg # gpm is sometimes used to assess efficiency

summary(mtcars$gpm)
summary(mtcars$mpg)

summary(mtcars)
```

Missing variables in an R data frame are indicated with NA. 

##### Try it out {- .tryitout}

The dataset `state.x77` contains information on US state statistics in the 1970s. By default, it is a matrix, but we can easily convert it to a data frame, as shown below. 

```{r}
data(state)
state_facts <- data.frame(state.x77)
state_facts <- cbind(state = row.names(state_facts), state_facts, stringsAsFactors = F) 
# State names were stored as row labels
# Store them in a variable instead, and add it to the data frame

row.names(state_facts) <- NULL # get rid of row names

head(state_facts)
```

1. How many rows and columns does it have? Can you find at least 3 ways to get that information?

2. The `Illiteracy` column contains the percent of the population of each state that is illiterate. Calculate the number of people in each state who are illiterate, and store that in a new column called `TotalNumIlliterate`. Note: `Population` contains the population in thousands.

3. Calculate the average population density of each state (population per square mile) and store it in a new column `PopDensity`. Using the R reference card, can you find functions that you can combine to get the state with the minimum population density?

<details>
```{r}
# 3 ways to get rows and columns
str(state_facts)
dim(state_facts)
nrow(state_facts)
ncol(state_facts)

# Illiteracy
state_facts$TotalNumIlliterate <- state_facts$Population * 1e3 * (state_facts$Illiteracy/100) 

# Population Density
state_facts$PopDensity <- state_facts$Population * 1e3/state_facts$Area 
# in people per square mile

# minimum population
state_facts$state[which.min(state_facts$PopDensity)]
```
</details>



#### Data Sets (SAS) {-}

The SAS data set structure is similar to a R data frame.

![This is a schematic of a data set as taken from the SAS documentation](https://documentation.sas.com/api/docsets/basess/9.4/content/images/data-fit.png)

The biggest difference is that in SAS, missing values are indicated with `.`.

SAS datasets also come with a description which is attached to the table. The descriptor portion of the data set records names of variables (and attributes), numbers of observations, and date/time stamps of creation and updates.

```{sashtml mj-data-step}

## Control structures

### If statements

If statements are just about as simple in programming as they are in real life. 


```{r, fig.cap = "[Source](https://xkcd.com/1652/)", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/conditionals.png")
```

In general, the structure of an if statement is 

````
if (condition) {
  # do something here
} 
````

If the condition is true, the inner code will be executed. Otherwise, nothing happens.

You can add an else statement that will execute if the condition is not true

````
if (condition) {
  # do something
} else {
  # do a different thing
}
````

And in some languages, you can even have many sets of if statements: 

```{r, eval = F}
if (condition) {
  # do something
} else if (condition 2) {
  # do something else
} else {
  # do a third thing
}
```

Note that this could also be written (perhaps more clearly) as: 

````
if (condition) {
  # do something
} else {
  if (condition 2) {
    # do something else
  } else {
    # do a third thing
  }
}
````
That is, `condition 2` is only checked once it is known that `condition` is false.


#### R example if statement

```{r}
tmp <- data.frame(name = c("Alex", "Edison", "Susan", "Ryan"),
                  status = c("naughty", "nice", NA, "neutral"),
                  stringsAsFactors = F)
# Santa's decision process

if (tmp$status == "naughty") {
 tmp$present <- "coal"
} else {
 tmp$present <- "toy"
}

tmp
```

What happened? 

When evaluating if statements, R does not evaluate each entry in the vector `tmp$status` separately. Instead, it takes the first value and issues a warning message. One option would be to use a loop, and examine each row in the data set separately. We'll talk about loops in the next subsection. Another option is to use the `ifelse()` function, which is `ifelse(condition, thing to do if condition is true, thing to do if condition is false)`

```{r}
tmp$present <- ifelse(tmp$status == "naughty", "coal", "toy")

tmp
```

When R evaluates a missing value, (so ? NA == "naughty"), the result is `NA`. This is fine for us - if we don't have data on whether someone is naughty or nice, maybe we don't need to give them a present at all. But "neutral" is evaluated as getting a toy. Do we want that to happen? Maybe not. We might have to nest ifelse statements to solve this issue...

```{r}
tmp$present <- ifelse(tmp$status == "naughty", 
                      "coal", 
                      ifelse(tmp$status == "nice", "toy", NA))

tmp
```

#### SAS example if statement

In a data step:
```{sashtml}
data santa;
  input name $ status $;
  datalines;
  Edison nice
  Alex naughty
  Susan .
  Ryan neutral
;

/* Modify santa_list and make a new dataset, present_list */
data presents;
  set santa;
  if status = "naughty" then present = "coal";
  else present = "toy";
run; /* must end with run if no datalines option */

proc print data=presents;
run;
```

Note that `.`, or missing data is handled the same as 'nice'. That might not be what we wanted... this is the natural thing to do, right?

````
data santa;
  input name $ status $;
  datalines;
  Edison nice
  Alex naughty
  Susan .
  Ryan neutral
;

/* Modify santa_list and make a new dataset, present_list */
data presents;
  set santa;
  if status = "naughty" then present = "coal";
  else (if status = "nice" then present = "toy" else present = .);
run; /* must end with run if no datalines option */

proc print data=presents;
run;
````

SAS doesn't handle nested if statements very well - they can be ambiguous. Instead, [SAS documentation suggests using `do;` and `end;` to denote the start and end points of each if statement](https://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=basess&docsetTarget=p0pcj5ajwyngron1wlsq0tet0hce.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en) (like the `{}` in R). 

```{sashtml}
data santa;
  input name $ status $;
  datalines;
  Edison nice
  Alex naughty
  Susan .
  Ryan neutral
;
data presents;
  set santa;
  if status = "naughty" then 
    do;
      present = "coal";
    end;
  else if status = "nice" then
    do;
      present = "toy";
    end;
  else 
    do;
      present = .;
    end;
run;
          
proc print data=presents;
run;
```

Interestingly, if you set a character variable to be missing, SAS converts it to '.'. So, if we actually want to have the value be missing, we can set it to an empty string.

```{sashtml}
data santa;
  input name $ status $;
  datalines;
  Edison nice
  Alex naughty
  Susan .
  Ryan neutral
;
data presents;
  set santa;
  if status = "naughty" then 
    do;
      present = "coal";
    end;
  else if status = "nice" then
    do;
      present = "toy";
    end;
  else 
    do;
      present = '';
    end;
run;
          
proc print data=presents;
run;
```

Now things work the way we expected them to work.

There are more complicated if-statement like control structures, such as cases, which can save time and typing, but almost anything can be done with sequences of if statements in the proper order.
